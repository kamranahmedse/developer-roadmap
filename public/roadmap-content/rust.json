The `if` and `else` structures are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. Similar to other languages, `while` and `for` are used for looping over a block of code. The `while` loop repeats a block of code until the condition is false, and the `for` loop is used to iterate over a collection of values, such as an array or a range. The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop. Rust's `match` structure, which is similar to switch statements in other languages, is a powerful tool used for pattern matching: it checks through different cases defined by the programmer and executes the block where the match is found. The `if let` syntax lets you combine `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest.\n\nLearn more from the following links:",

Patterns can be made up of literal values, variable names, wildcards, and many other things.

Unlike enumerations in some other languages, variants in Rust are not restricted to a singular data type. When you define an `enum`, you can decide for each of its possible variants whether or not that variant will hold additional embedded data; each variant of the enum is also allowed to hold data of completely different types and amounts.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard.\n\nRust supports two types of floating-point numbers: `f32` and `f64`. These are 32-bit and 64-bit in size, respectively.\n\n*   `f32` (_binary32_ type defined in IEEE-754-2008) is a single-precision float, which means is less precise than `f64` type.\n*   `f64` (_binary64_ type defined in IEEE-754-2008) has double precision. The default type is `f64` because on modern CPUs it’s roughly the same speed as `f32` but allows more precision.\n\nBoth `f32` and `f64` represent negative, zero and positive floating-point values.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
