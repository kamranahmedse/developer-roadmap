    "title": "How to approach System Design?",
    "description": "There are several steps that can be taken when approaching a system design:\n\n*   **Understand the problem**: Gather information about the problem you are trying to solve and the requirements of the system. Identify the users and their needs, as well as any constraints or limitations of the system.\n*   **Identify the scope of the system:** Define the boundaries of the system, including what the system will do and what it will not do.\n*   **Research and analyze existing systems:** Look at similar systems that have been built in the past and identify what worked well and what didn't. Use this information to inform your design decisions.\n*   **Create a high-level design:** Outline the main components of the system and how they will interact with each other. This can include a rough diagram of the system's architecture, or a flowchart outlining the process the system will follow.\n*   **Refine the design:** As you work on the details of the design, iterate and refine it until you have a complete and detailed design that meets all the requirements.\n*   **Document the design:** Create detailed documentation of your design for future reference and maintenance.\n*   **Continuously monitor and improve the system:** The system design is not a one-time process, it needs to be continuously monitored and improved to meet the changing requirements.\n\nNote that this is a general approach to System Design.

This is often measured in terms of the percentage of time that the system is up and running, also known as its uptime.\n\nConsistency, on the other hand, refers to the property that all clients see the same data at the same time. This is important for maintaining the integrity of the data stored in the system.\n\nIn distributed systems, it is often a trade-off between availability and consistency. Systems that prioritize high availability may sacrifice consistency, while systems that prioritize consistency may sacrifice availability. Different distributed systems use different approaches to balance the trade-off between availability and consistency, such as using replication or consensus algorithms.\n\nHave a look at the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "Failover is an availability pattern that is used to ensure that a system can continue to function in the event of a failure. It involves having a backup component or system that can take over in the event of a failure.\n\nIn a failover system, there is a primary component that is responsible for handling requests, and a secondary (or backup) component that is on standby. The primary component is monitored for failures, and if it fails, the secondary component is activated to take over its duties. This allows the system to continue functioning with minimal disruption.\n\nFailover can be implemented in various ways, such as active-passive, active-active, and hot-standby.\n\nActive-passive\n--------------\n\nWith active-passive fail-over, heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby. If the heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active's IP address and resumes service.\n\nThe length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in 'hot' standby or whether it needs to start up from 'cold' standby. Only the active server handles traffic.\n\nActive-passive failover can also be referred to as master-slave failover.\n\nActive-active\n-------------\n\nIn active-active, both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them.\n\nIf the servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers. If the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers.\n\nActive-active failover can also be referred to as master-master failover.\n\nDisadvantages of Failover\n-------------------------\n\n*   Fail-over adds more hardware and additional complexity.\n*   There is a potential for loss of data if the active system fails before any newly written data can be replicated to the passive.\n\nTo learn more visit the following links:",

This allows for high availability and allows any of the servers to take over if one of them fails. However, this type of replication can lead to conflicts if multiple servers update the same data at the same time, so some conflict resolution mechanism is needed to handle this.\n    \n*   **Master-Slave replication:** In this type of replication, one server is designated as the \"master\" and handles all write operations, while multiple \"slave\" servers handle read operations. If the master fails, one of the slaves can be promoted to take its place.

This type of caching can help improve the performance of an application by reducing the number of times the client needs to request data from the server.\n\nOne common example of client-side caching is web browsers caching frequently accessed web pages and resources. When a user visits a web page, the browser stores a copy of the page and its resources (such as images, stylesheets, and scripts) in the browser's cache. If the user visits the same page again, the browser can retrieve the cached version of the page and its resources instead of requesting them from the server, which can reduce the load time of the page.\n\nAnother example of client-side caching is application-level caching. Some applications, such as mobile apps, can cache data on the client's device to improve performance and reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network.\n\nClient side caching has some advantages like reducing server load, faster page load times, and reducing network traffic. However, it also has some drawbacks like the potential for stale data if the client-side cache is not properly managed, or consuming memory or disk space on the client's device.\n\nLearn more from the following links:",

If the content is found in the cache, it is served to the user from the nearby server. If the content is not found in the cache, it is requested from the origin server (the original source of the content) and then cached on the nearby server for future requests.\n\nCDN caching can significantly improve the performance and availability of a website by reducing the distance that data needs to travel, reducing the load on the origin server, and allowing for faster delivery of content to end-users.",

Tweaking these settings for specific usage patterns can further boost performance. it's like having a quick-access memory for frequently used data in applications. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n1.  **Quick Access**: Imagine you're looking up information in a big library (the database). Instead of going to the library every time you need the same book (data), you keep a copy of it on your desk (cache).\n    \n2.  **Faster Retrieval**: When you need that book again, you first check your desk (cache). If it's there, great! You get it right away without going to the library (database) again.\n    \n3.  **Saving Time**: If the book isn't on your desk (cache miss), you go to the library (database) to get it. But you make sure to put a copy on your desk for next time, so you won't have to go to the library again if you need it soon.\n    \n4.  **Different Types**: There are different ways to do this caching. You can cache the results of searches (like bookmarking), whole pieces of information (like keeping a paper copy), or even entire web pages (like saving a snapshot).\n    \n5.  **Benefits**: By keeping frequently used data close by, you save time and reduce the strain on the library (database). It's like having your most-used books right at your fingertips, making your work faster and more efficient.\n    \n\nHowever, it's important to keep the cached data up to date. Otherwise, you might end up with outdated information, like using an old edition of a book instead of the latest one. So, managing this cache properly is key to keeping things running smoothly.",

This is useful with DHCP because the client has not yet received an IP address, thus preventing a way for TCP to stream without the IP address.\n\nUDP is less reliable but works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, streaming, and realtime multiplayer games.\n\nUse UDP over TCP when:\n\n*   You need the lowest latency\n*   Late data is worse than loss of data\n*   You want to implement your own error correction\n\nTo learn more, visit the following link:",

    "title": "RPC",
    "description": "In an RPC, a client causes a procedure to execute on a different address space, usually a remote server. The procedure is coded as if it were a local procedure call, abstracting away the details of how to communicate with the server from the client program. Remote calls are usually slower and less reliable than local calls so it is helpful to distinguish RPC calls from local calls. Popular RPC frameworks include [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/), and [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/).\n\nRPC is a request-response protocol:\n\n*   Client program - Calls the client stub procedure. The parameters are pushed onto the stack like a local procedure call.\n*   Client stub procedure - Marshals (packs) procedure id and arguments into a request message.\n*   Client communication module - OS sends the message from the client to the server.\n*   Server communication module - OS passes the incoming packets to the server stub procedure.\n*   Server stub procedure - Unmarshalls the results, calls the server procedure matching the procedure id and passes the given arguments.\n*   The server response repeats the steps above in reverse order.\n\nSample RPC calls:\n\n    GET /someoperation?data=anId\n    \n    POST /anotheroperation\n    {\n      \"data\":\"anId\";\n      \"anotherdata\": \"another value\"\n    }\n    \n\nRPC is focused on exposing behaviors. RPCs are often used for performance reasons with internal communications, as you can hand-craft native calls to better fit your use cases.\n\nDisadvantage of RPC\n-------------------\n\n*   RPC clients become tightly coupled to the service implementation.\n*   A new API must be defined for every new operation or use case.\n*   It can be difficult to debug RPC.\n*   You might not be able to leverage existing technologies out of the box. For example, it might require additional effort to ensure [RPC calls are properly cached](http://etherealbits.com/2012/12/debunking-the-myths-of-rpc-rest/) on caching servers such as [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/).\n\nTo learn more, visit the following links:",

    "description": "REST is an architectural style enforcing a client/server model where the client acts on a set of resources managed by the server. The server provides a representation of resources and actions that can either manipulate or get a new representation of resources. All communication must be stateless and cacheable.\n\nThere are four qualities of a RESTful interface:\n\n*   Identify resources (URI in HTTP) - use the same URI regardless of any operation.\n*   Change with representations (Verbs in HTTP) - use verbs, headers, and body.\n*   Self-descriptive error message (status response in HTTP) - Use status codes, don't reinvent the wheel.\n*   HATEOAS (HTML interface for HTTP) - your web service should be fully accessible in a browser.\n\nREST is focused on exposing data. It minimizes the coupling between client/server and is often used for public HTTP APIs. REST uses a more generic and uniform method of exposing resources through URIs, representation through headers, and actions through verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH. Being stateless, REST is great for horizontal scaling and partitioning.\n\nTo learn more, visit the following links:",

    "description": "Usage monitoring tracks how the features and components of an application are used. An operator can use the gathered data to:\n\n*   Determine which features are heavily used and determine any potential hotspots in the system. High-traffic elements might benefit from functional partitioning or even replication to spread the load more evenly. An operator can also use this information to ascertain which features are infrequently used and are possible candidates for retirement or replacement in a future version of the system.\n*   Obtain information about the operational events of the system under normal use. For example, in an e-commerce site, you can record the statistical information about the number of transactions and the volume of customers that are responsible for them. This information can be used for capacity planning as the number of customers grows.\n*   Detect (possibly indirectly) user satisfaction with the performance or functionality of the system. For example, if a large number of customers in an e-commerce system regularly abandon their shopping carts, this might be due to a problem with the checkout functionality.\n*   Generate billing information. A commercial application or multitenant service might charge customers for the resources that they use.\n*   Enforce quotas. If a user in a multitenant system exceeds their paid quota of processing time or resource usage during a specified period, their access can be limited or processing can be throttled.\n\nLearn more from the following links:",
