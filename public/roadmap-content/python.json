Python supports OOP with features such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n*   Functional programming: This paradigm is based on the idea of functions as first-class citizens, and it emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutable data. Python supports functional programming with features such as higher-order functions, lambda expressions, and generators.\n*   Aspect-oriented programming: This paradigm is based on the idea of separating cross-cutting concerns from the main functionality of a program.
