Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) automates this process by inserting memory management method calls during compilation, though it still uses reference counting. In contrast, Garbage Collection (GC) automatically tracks object ownership and releases unreferenced objects, using a different mechanism than MRR and ARC, and is supported only in the macOS X runtime environment, not on iOS.\n\n> Beginning May 1, 2015, new Mac apps and app updates submitted to the Mac App Store may no longer use garbage collection, which was deprecated in OS X Mountain Lion. Instead, migrate your apps to Automatic Reference Counting, using the migration assistant in Xcode to help with this transition. Apps may continue to use retain/release for manual memory management.

They are typically created using the `$` prefix on a `@State` property. This approach facilitates the flow of data through an app's view hierarchy, enabling reactive UI updates and maintaining a single source of truth.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

It employs a declarative syntax where UI is described using Swift code, defining what should appear rather than how to create it. Xcode provides real-time previews of the UI as you code, enhancing the development experience. SwiftUI uses property wrappers like `@State` for managing UI state, and offers a flexible layout system with VStack, HStack, and ZStack. Complex UIs are built by composing smaller, reusable views, and data flow between views is managed using `@Binding` and `@ObservedObject`. The framework provides chainable modifiers for customizing view appearance and behavior, easy-to-implement declarative animations, and built-in support for common gestures. SwiftUI simplifies UI development by reducing boilerplate code and offering a more intuitive way to create responsive, adaptive interfaces that can target iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS from a single codebase.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

    "description": "The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern assigns objects in an application one of three roles: model, view, or controller. The pattern defines not only the roles objects play in the application, it defines the way objects communicate with each other. Each of the three types of objects is separated from the others by abstract boundaries and communicates with objects of the other types across those boundaries. The collection of objects of a certain MVC type in an application is sometimes referred to as a layer—for example, model layer.\n\nMVC is central to a good design for a Cocoa application. The benefits of adopting this pattern are numerous. Many objects in these applications tend to be more reusable, and their interfaces tend to be better defined. Applications having an MVC design are also more easily extensible than other applications. Moreover, many Cocoa technologies and architectures are based on MVC and require that your custom objects play one of the MVC roles\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

This pattern is particularly useful for handling events or customizing behavior without creating tight dependencies between classes. In implementation, a delegate protocol defines methods that the delegating object can call, while the delegate object conforms to this protocol and provides specific implementations. This approach promotes loose coupling, enhances reusability, and allows for easy customization of component behavior. The delegate pattern is extensively used in UIKit for handling user interactions, data source management, and event callbacks, making it a fundamental concept in iOS app architecture and design.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

The process typically begins with defining a protocol that outlines the required and optional methods. Next, a weak delegate property is declared in the delegating class to avoid retain cycles. The delegating class then calls the delegate methods at appropriate times, often in response to specific events or state changes. On the delegate side, the class conforms to the protocol and implements the required methods, providing custom behavior as needed. This implementation allows for flexible and reusable code, as the delegating object doesn't need to know the specific type of its delegate, only that it conforms to the protocol.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

They allow a function to pass control back to the caller once a task is completed, making them particularly useful for handling time-consuming operations or events that occur at unpredictable times. In Swift, callbacks are often implemented using closures, which are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and executed later. This approach is commonly used in network operations, user interface events, and any scenario where the result of an operation isn't immediately available.\n\nWhile simple to implement for basic use cases, callbacks can lead to complex nested structures (often referred to as \"callback hell\") in more intricate scenarios. To mitigate this, Swift offers more advanced patterns like completion handlers, promises, and async/await syntax, which provide cleaner ways to handle asynchronous operations while maintaining the core concept of passing control back to the caller upon completion.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

This behavior is crucial for maintaining state in asynchronous operations but can lead to memory management challenges if not handled carefully. Swift provides capture lists to explicitly define how values should be captured, allowing developers to specify weak or unowned references to avoid retain cycles. Proper management of captured values is essential for preventing memory leaks, especially in scenarios involving self-referential closures or delegate patterns.

This problem typically arises when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations that depend on each other's results. As callbacks are nested within callbacks, the code structure becomes deeply indented, resembling a pyramid shape. This nesting not only hampers code readability but also makes error handling and flow control more complex. To mitigate callback hell, developers often employ techniques such as modularizing code, using named functions instead of anonymous closures, or adopting more advanced asynchronous patterns.

HTTPS extends HTTP by encrypting the data exchange using SSL/TLS protocols, ensuring secure communication. In iOS development, URLSession handles both HTTP and HTTPS requests seamlessly, automatically managing the encryption for HTTPS connections. Developers typically use HTTPS for all network communications to protect user data and maintain privacy. iOS enforces App Transport Security (ATS) by default, requiring secure connections for network requests. When working with web APIs, iOS apps use these protocols to fetch data, submit forms, upload files, and perform various other network operations. Understanding HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), status codes, and headers is crucial for effective API integration and troubleshooting in iOS app development.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

In iOS, developers interact with REST APIs using URLSession or higher-level networking libraries. These APIs usually exchange data in JSON format, which integrates well with Swift's Codable protocol for easy serialization and deserialization. REST's stateless nature and use of standard HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT for updates, DELETE for removal) make it intuitive and scalable. When implementing RESTful services in iOS apps, developers focus on endpoint design, proper use of HTTP status codes, and efficient data mapping between API responses and Swift objects.
