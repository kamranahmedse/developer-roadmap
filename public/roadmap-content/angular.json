    "description": "Angular is a popular open-source front-end web application framework developed by Google. It is written in TypeScript and allows developers to build dynamic, single-page web applications with ease. Angular provides a comprehensive set of features for creating interactive and responsive user interfaces, making it a powerful tool for modern web development.\n\nOne of the key features of Angular is its use of components, which are reusable building blocks for creating web applications. Components encapsulate the HTML, CSS, and TypeScript code needed to define a specific part of a web page, making it easier to manage and maintain complex applications. Angular also includes a powerful dependency injection system, which helps manage the dependencies between different parts of an application and promotes code reusability. Additionally, Angular provides tools for routing, form handling, and state management, making it a versatile framework for building a wide range of web applications.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

    "description": "Angular follows a modular architecture pattern, dividing the application into distinct modules, components, services, and other elements, which enhances code organization and maintainability. The key building blocks include modules, which are containers grouping related components, services, directives, and other elements to ensure proper encapsulation and reusability. Components are the building blocks of Angular applications, representing parts of the user interface with associated logic, consisting of templates, styles, and a class defining behavior. Services encapsulate reusable business logic, data manipulation, and API communication, enabling data and functionality sharing across components. Directives are HTML attributes or elements that extend HTML functionality, allowing reusable behaviors across the application. Lastly, pipes transform data before displaying it in templates, providing convenient ways to format, filter, and sort data.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

This means that changes in the child component can be propagated back to the parent component, ensuring synchronization between the two. Model inputs automatically create a corresponding output, typically named by appending “Change” to the input’s name, to facilitate this two-way communication.\n\nTo facilitate communication between unrelated components, it’s most effective to trigger events using `EventEmitter` and have the components listen for these events. This approach ensures a decoupled and flexible architecture, allowing components to interact seamlessly without direct dependencies.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "Angular’s module architecture organizes an application into cohesive units called NgModules, each defined by the @NgModule decorator. These modules group related components, directives, pipes, and services to encapsulate functionality and promote modular development. The root module (AppModule) is the entry point, bootstrapping the application and importing essential modules like BrowserModule. Feature modules encapsulate specific functionalities and can be eagerly or lazily loaded to improve performance and manageability. Shared modules group reusable components and services to prevent code duplication. The @NgModule metadata includes properties like imports, declarations, exports, providers, and bootstrap, which help manage dependencies, declarations, visibility, service providers, and the root component. This modular approach enhances code organization, scalability, and maintainability in Angular applications.\n\nVisit following resources to learn more:",

They are used when the built-in validators (like `required`, `minLength`, etc.) do not meet your specific validation requirements. A custom validator is a function that returns either `null` if the form control is valid, or an object that represents the validation error if it is invalid. This object typically contains a key-value pair where the key is the error name and the value is a boolean or some details about the error.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

Otherwise observers can receive data values from the observable continuously and asynchronously. So we can perform various operations such as updating the user interface, or passing the JSON response.\n\nThere are 4 stages for a life cycle of an observable.\n\n*   Creation\n*   Subscription\n*   Execution\n*   Destruction\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "title": "Operators",
    "description": "RxJS is mostly useful for its operators, even though the Observable is the foundation. Operators are the essential pieces that allow complex asynchronous code to be easily composed in a declarative manner.\n\nOperators are functions. There are two kinds of operators:\n\n**Pipeable Operators** are the kind that can be piped to Observables using the syntax observableInstance.pipe(operator()). These include, filter(...), and mergeMap(...). When called, they do not change the existing Observable instance. Instead, they return a new Observable, whose subscription logic is based on the first Observable.\n\nA Pipeable Operator is essentially a pure function which takes one Observable as input and generates another Observable as output. Subscribing to the output Observable will also subscribe to the input Observable.\n\n**Creation Operators** are the other kind of operator, which can be called as standalone functions to create a new Observable. For example: of(1, 2, 3) creates an observable that will emit 1, 2, and 3, one right after another. Creation operators will be discussed in more detail in a later section.\n\nPiping\n------\n\nPipeable operators are functions, so they could be used like ordinary functions: op()(obs) — but in practice, there tend to be many of them convolved together, and quickly become unreadable: op4()(op3()(op2()(op1()(obs)))). For that reason, Observables have a method called .pipe() that accomplishes the same thing while being much easier to read:\n\n     obs.pipe(op1(), op2(), op3(), op4());\n    \n\nCreation Operators\n------------------\n\n**What are creation operators?** Distinct from pipeable operators, creation operators are functions that can be used to create an Observable with some common predefined behavior or by joining other Observables.\n\nA typical example of a creation operator would be the interval function. It takes a number (not an Observable) as input argument, and produces an Observable as output:\n\n    import { interval } from 'rxjs';\n    \n    const observable = interval(1000 /* number of milliseconds */);\n    \n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

This can be useful in situations where the rate of incoming data is higher than the rate at which it can be processed, or where there are limits on the number of requests that can be made to a server. There are a few different operators in RxJS that can be used for rate limiting, such as throttleTime and sampleTime. These operators can be used to limit the rate of emissions from an observable by discarding emissions that occur too frequently. Another operator is auditTime it emits the last value from the source Observable during periodic time windows.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

In computer science, an input is information put into the program by the user and state refers to the condition of an application according to its stored inputs -- saved as variables or constants. State can also be described as the collection of preserved information that forms a complete session.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

To integrate reusable library code into an application, you need to install the package and import the provided functionality in the location you use it. For most published Angular libraries, use the `ng add <lib_name>` Angular CLI command. A published library typically provides a `README` file or other documentation on how to add that library to your application. A library is able to be updated by the publisher, and also has individual dependencies which need to be kept current. To check for updates to your installed libraries, use the `ng update` Angular CLI command.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Sanitizing resource URLs isn't possible because they contain arbitrary code. In development mode, Angular prints a console warning when it has to change a value during sanitization.\n\nInterpolated content is always escaped —the HTML isn't interpreted and the browser displays angle brackets in the element's text content.\n\nFor the HTML to be interpreted, bind it to an HTML property such as `innerHTML`.

There are many ways in which a malicious website can transmit such commands; specially-crafted image tags, hidden forms, and JavaScript fetch or XMLHttpRequests, for example, can all work without the user's interaction or knowledge. Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS), which exploits the trust a user has for a particular site, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser. In a CSRF attack, an innocent end user is tricked by an attacker into submitting a web request that they did not intend. This may cause actions to be performed on the website that can include inadvertent client or server data leakage, change of session state, or manipulation of an end user's account. Angular provides built-in protection against CSRF attacks through the `HttpClientXsrfModule` module. This module automatically adds a token to outgoing requests and validates it on the server side.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

An asterisk `*` or wildcard matches any animation state. This is useful for defining transitions that apply regardless of the HTML element's start or end state. Use the `void` state to configure transitions for an element that is entering or leaving a page.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
