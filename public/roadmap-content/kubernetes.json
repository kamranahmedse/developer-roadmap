K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between the \"K\" and the \"s\". Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google's experience running production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Container networking interface (CNI) plugins are used to configure pod network interfaces and provide isolation between pods. Kubernetes also provides networking services such as load balancing, service discovery, and ingress, which enable external traffic to access pods and services. These services are implemented using Kubernetes objects such as Services, Ingress, and NetworkPolicies. Networking and pod-to-pod communication are essential for scalability, reliability, and flexibility in Kubernetes clusters.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "Helm is a Kubernetes package manager that simplifies the deployment and management of complex applications through the use of reusable and versioned Helm charts. These charts are composed of YAML files that describe related sets of Kubernetes resources and can be customized using values files and templating with Go templates. Helm charts can also have dependencies on other charts and be stored in a centralized repository like Helm Hub for easy sharing and access. By utilizing Helm, teams can streamline application management and reduce duplication of effort.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

This approach allows for testing the new version under real-world conditions before fully committing to the update. In Kubernetes, canary deployments can be implemented using tools such as Istio, Linkerd, or Nginx, or by using built-in features like deployment strategies and traffic routing.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
