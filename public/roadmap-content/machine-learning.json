This correction is achieved by focusing on the instances that were poorly predicted by the existing ensemble, effectively \"boosting\" the performance on those difficult cases.

    "title": "Prediction",
    "description": "In scikit-learn, prediction means using a trained machine learning model to estimate an output (or target variable) for new, unseen data. After a model is trained on a dataset, it learns the relationship between the input features and the target variable. To make a prediction, you provide the model with new input features, and it uses the learned relationship to generate a predicted value for the target. This is typically done using the `.predict()` method on a trained model object, which takes the new data as input and returns the model's predictions.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
