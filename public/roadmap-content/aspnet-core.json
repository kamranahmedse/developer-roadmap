These scenarios can be written by non-technical stakeholders, such as business analysts or product owners, and can be easily understood by anyone who reads them. SpecFlow then converts these Gherkin scenarios into executable tests, which can be run using a variety of test runners, such as NUnit, xUnit, or MSTest. The tool also provides a set of bindings that allow developers to map the steps in the Gherkin scenarios to code in their application, making it easy to test specific functionality.
