    "description": "ML programming fundamentals encompass the essential skills and concepts needed to develop machine learning models effectively. Key aspects include understanding data structures and algorithms, as well as proficiency in programming languages commonly used in ML, such as Python and R. Familiarity with libraries and frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn is crucial for implementing machine learning algorithms and building models. Additionally, concepts such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning are vital for optimizing performance. A solid grasp of statistics and linear algebra is also important, as these mathematical foundations underpin many ML techniques, enabling practitioners to analyze data and interpret model results accurately.",

The airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed. When workflows are defined as code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

This process begins with feeding the model a training dataset, which it uses to learn and understand patterns or perform computations. The model's performance is then evaluated by comparing its prediction outputs with the actual results. Various algorithms can be used in the model training process. The choice of algorithm usually depends on the task, the data available, and the requirements of the project. It is worth noting that the model training stage can be computationally expensive particularly when dealing with large datasets or complex models.\n\nDecisions depend on the organization's infrastructure.\n\n*   **Repository Suggestion:** [ML Deployment k8s Fast API](https://github.com/sayakpaul/ml-deployment-k8s-fastapi/tree/main)\n*   **Tutorial Suggestions:** [ML deployment with k8s FastAPI, Building an ML app with FastAPI](https://dev.to/bravinsimiyu/beginner-guide-on-how-to-build-a-machine-learning-app-with-fastapi-part-ii-deploying-the-fastapi-application-to-kubernetes-4j6g), [Basic Kubeflow pipeline](https://towardsdatascience.com/tutorial-basic-kubeflow-pipeline-from-scratch-5f0350dc1905), [Building and deploying ML pipelines](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/kubeflow-tutorial-building-and-deploying-machine-learning-pipelines?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720818&utm_adgroupid=157156373991&utm_device=c&utm_keyword=&utm_matchtype=&utm_network=g&utm_adpostion=&utm_creative=683184494153&utm_targetid=dsa-2218886984380&utm_loc_interest_ms=&utm_loc_physical_ms=9064564&utm_content=&utm_campaign=230119_1-sea~dsa~tofu_2-b2c_3-eu_4-prc_5-na_6-na_7-le_8-pdsh-go_9-na_10-na_11-na-dec23&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA4Y-sBhC6ARIsAGXF1g7iSih9h2RGL27LwWY6dlPLhEss-e5Af8pnaBvdDynRh7IHIKi8sGgaApD-EALw_wcB), [KServe tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/kserve-highly-scalable-machine-learning-deployment-with-kubernetes-aa7af0b71202)",

Monitoring helps to detect any anomalies in the model’s behaviour or performance and such alerts can trigger the retraining of models with new data.
