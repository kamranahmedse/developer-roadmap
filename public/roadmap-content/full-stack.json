I recommend you to build as many test projects at each yellow step of the roadmap as possible to solidify what you learn.\n\nThe practice that I used to follow when I was learning was this:\n\n*   While you are watching a course or reading a book, make sure to code along with the instructor/author — pause the video at regular intervals and code what you are being taught.\n*   Search on YouTube and watch a few project based tutorials on the topic that you are learning. Apart from coding along with the instructor:\n    *   Try to build the same project at least 2 to 3 times on your own without looking at the video. If you get stuck, refer to the section of the video where the instructor builds that part of the project.\n    *   Build something else that is similar to the project that you just built. For example, if you just built a todo app, try to build a notes app or a reminder app.\n\nProject Ideas\n-------------\n\nNow that you have learnt HTML and CSS, here are a few ideas for you to build:\n\n*   Try to copy the design of a website that you like.\n    *   Here is a [simple blog design in figma](https://www.figma.com/file/nh0V05z3NB87ue9v5PcO3R/writings.dev?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=2iQplaIojU3ydAfW-1) that you can try to copy.\n    *   Or try to rebuild the [webpages of this website](https://cs.fyi/).\n*   Take some inspiration from [personal portfolios of others](https://astro.build/showcase/) and build your own personal portfolio",

    "description": "**CRUD** stands for **Create, Read, Update, and Delete**. These are the four basic operations you can perform on any data when working with web applications, databases, and APIs.\n\nNow that you know about programming language and the databases, you should be able to build a simple CLI application that interacts with database. We haven't talked about the APIs yet but you don't need an API to practice CRUD operations. Here are some of the CLI applications you can build to practice CRUD operations:\n\n*   A simple todo list application for the CLI with the following options:\n    *   `--new` to add a new todo item\n    *   `--list [all|pending|done]` to list the todo items\n    *   `--done [id]` to update a todo item\n    *   `--delete [id]` to delete a todo item\n    *   `--help` to list all the available options\n    *   `--version` to print the version of the application",

Template files will have placeholders that you will need to replace with user data.\n*   Build a simple e-commerce application which will have two types of users i.e. **Sellers** who can: Register as Seller, Login, Setup their store, Add products, Edit products, Delete products, View Received Orders, Update Order Status (Pending, Shipped, Delivered), **Buyers** who can register, Login, Browse products by all sellers, Add products to cart, Checkout, View order history, View order status, Cancel order, View seller profile, View seller products\n\nThese are just some ideas to get you started.

    "description": "Now that you have the infrastructure setup, it's time to automate the deployment process. This is where CI / CD comes in. If you don't know what CI/CD are, you should watch [DevOps CI/CD Explained in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scEDHsr3APg).\n\nThe next step at this point is to implement CI/CD for your application using GitHub actions. Setup a GitHub action that, whenever you push to master, will automatically:\n\n*   Run your tests (ignore this step if you haven't learnt it yet)\n*   Deploy your application to AWS\n\nRegarding the deployment to AWS you can use `rsync` to copy the files to the server. Here's a [sample GitHub workflow](https://gist.github.com/kamranahmedse/1e94b412006040f38e24b9443b2da41a) using `rsync`.",

Now that you know terraform, go ahead and automate the process of creating the infrastructure for your application using terraform and with that your deployments will be fully automated i.e., you should have:\n\n*   Infrastructure setup using terraform\n*   Provisioning using Ansible\n*   CI/CD using GitHub Actions\n*   Monitoring using Monit\n\nAnd that is it!
