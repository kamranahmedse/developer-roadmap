Essentially, it is the smallest convex polygon that can enclose a set of points in a two-dimensional space, or the smallest convex polyhedron for a set of points in a three-dimensional space. It can be thought of as the shape that a rubber band would take if it was stretched around the points and then released. In computational geometry, various algorithms like Graham's Scan and QuickHull have been developed to compute Convex Hulls rapidly. Using Convex Hulls in game engines can drastically improve the performance of collision detection routines as fewer points need to be checked for overlap, which in turn helps in creating smoother gameplay.",

This technique considerably simplifies the computation involved in collision detection, a critical aspect of any game development project that involves physical simulations. In concrete terms, a concave shape has one or more parts that 'cave in' or have recesses, while a convex shape has no such depressions - in simplistic terms, it 'bulges out' with no interior angles exceeding 180 degrees. So, Convex decomposition is essentially a process of breaking down a shape with 'caves' or 'recesses' into simpler shapes that only 'bulge out'.",

They create depth and a sense of a three-dimensional space in a two-dimensional display. **Lighting** in game development mimics real-world light properties. It involves calculating how light interacts with different objects and surfaces based on their material characteristics and the light's intensity, direction, and color. Various algorithms, like Ray Tracing or Rasterization, are used to simulate these interactions. On the other hand, **shadows** are the areas unlit due to the blockage of light by an object. Producing realistic shadows involves complex computations, factoring in the light's position, the blocking object's shape and size, and the affected area's distance. Shadow Mapping and Shadow Volume are common techniques for creating shadows in game development. Special attention to these aspects can dramatically increase the perceived realism and immersion in the game environment.",

This process involves two steps - generating the shadow map and then rendering the scene.\n\nIn the shadow map generating step, the scene is rendered from the perspective of the light source capturing depth information. This results in a texture that stores the distance from the light to the nearest surface along each light direction, a “shadow map”.\n\nIn the scene rendering step, the scene is rendered from the camera’s perspective. For each visible surface point, its distance from the light is calculated and compared to the corresponding stored distance in the shadow map. If the point's distance is greater than the stored distance, the point is in shadow; otherwise, it's lit. This information is used to adjust the color of the point, producing the shadow effect.",

    "title": "Real-time Ray Tracing",
    "description": "**Real-time Ray Tracing** is a notable advancement in rendering technology. It aims to mimic the way light works in the real world by simulating how each ray of light interacts with different surfaces. In real-time ray tracing, rays of light are generated from the viewer's perspective and sent into the scene. They can reflect off surfaces, refract through materials, or scatter in different directions. These rays can also be absorbed, producing shadows and shaping the visibility of objects. What makes real-time ray tracing special is its ability to calculate all these interactions in real-time, which allows graphics to be much more dynamic and interactive. The complexity of real-time ray tracing involves extensive computational power and it has been a groundbreaking feature in newer hardware and software releases.",

It delivers real-time, cinema-quality rendering to contend development in gaming and professional visualization. It provides highly efficient and straightforward access to RT Core hardware. DXR adds four new concepts to DirectX 12: The acceleration structure, The Raytracing pipeline state object, Shader tables, and the Command list method (DispatchRays). It represents a significant step forward by Microsoft in embracing Ray Tracing as a new standard in real-time rendering pipelines. For developers, DirectX Ray tracing is straightforward to integrate into existing engines given its easy compatibility with existing DirectX 12 programming models. However, to truly maximize DXR's potential, a deep understanding of both graphics workloads and tracing algorithms is necessary.",

    "description": "Physically Based Rendering (PBR) is a technique in computer graphics that aims to mimic the interaction of light with surfaces in the real world. It models how light behaves, from reflection to refraction, in a way that accurately represents reality. The PBR model factors in physical properties of materials, such as roughness or metallicity, making the rendering output more consistent and predictable under different lighting conditions. It uses complex shading algorithms and light calculations to generate a high level of realism. In order to achieve this, many PBR systems use a combination of two important components: the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), which defines how light is reflected off an object, and the Bidirectional Surface Scattering Reflectance Distribution Function (BSSRDF), which handles how light scatters under the surface of an object.",

Transparency refers to the property of an object that allows light to pass through it unhindered, hence making the object clear or invisible. This is commonly seen in materials such as glass, clear plastic, and water. On the other hand, translucency describes how light interacts with a semi-transparent object. Instead of passing directly through, light enters the object, travels within for some distance and then exits at a different location. Common examples of such surfaces include human skin, marble, milk, or wax, which exhibit a soft, diffused lighting effect when light rays pass through them. The technique to achieve this effect in graphics involves subsurface scattering, where incoming light is scattered beneath the object's surface, illuminated it in a way that showcases the material's internal structure.",

    "description": "In Physically Based Rendering (PBR), **Metallicity** is a critical property of a material, which influences how it interacts with light. It's a binary property, indicating whether the material is a 'metal' or 'non-metal'. Metals have a high metallicity value (often 1), non-metals (such as wood, plastic, etc.) have a low metallicity value (often 0). Interestingly, with PBR, there exists no 'partially metal' materials ― it's an all or nothing characteristic. This property significantly impacts color handling, too, as metals derive their color from specular reflection while non-metals derive from subsurface scattering (diffuse).",

This process involves the penetration of light into the surface of a material, where it is scattered by interacting with the material. In other words, when light strikes an object, rather than simply bouncing off the surface, some of it goes into the object and gets scattered around inside before getting re-emitted. It is key to achieving more realistic rendering of translucent materials like skin, marble, milk, and more. Consider it essential for replicating how light interacts with real-world materials in a convincing manner in your game.",
