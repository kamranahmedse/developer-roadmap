These typically include `if...else` statements.\n*   **Iteration** control structures (also known as _loops_) allow a block of code to be repeated multiple times.

A key principle of OOP is the ability to hide certain parts of the objects’ data from the outside, a concept known as encapsulation.

The data is stored in nodes, each of which contains a data field and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. Structurally, a linked list is organized into a sequence or chain of nodes, hence the name. Two types of linked lists are commonly used: singly linked lists, where each node points to the next node and the last node points to null, and doubly linked lists, where each node has two links, one to the previous node and another one to the next. Linked Lists are used in other types of data structures like stacks and queues.\n\nLearn more from the following links:",

The aim is to identify the worst-case, average-case, and best-case complexity. Generally, the main focus is on the worst-case scenario which represents the maximum number of steps taken by an algorithm. To calculate it, you consider the highest order of size (n) in your algorithm's steps. For instance, if an algorithm performs a loop 5 times for 'n' items, and then does 3 unrelated steps, it has a complexity of O(n), because the linear steps grow faster than constant ones as n increases. Other complexities include O(1) for constant complexity, O(n) for linear complexity, O(n^2) for quadratic complexity, and so on, based on how the steps increase with size.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted. This process continues until the base case is achieved, which is when the array or sub-array has zero or one element, hence is already sorted. Quicksort can have worst-case performance of O(n^2) if the pivot is the smallest or the largest element in the array, although this scenario is rare if the pivot is chosen randomly.

    "description": "Heap Sort is an efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm. It utilizes a data structure known as a 'binary heap', and works by dividing its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and iteratively shrinking the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region. It's an in-place algorithm but not a stable sort. It involves building a Max-Heap, which is a specialized tree-based data structure, and then swapping the root node (maximum element) with the last node, reducing the size of heap by one and heapifying the root node. The maximum element is now at the end of the list and this step is repeated until all nodes are sorted. Heap Sort offers a good worst-case runtime of O(n log n), irrespective of the input data.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

    "description": "`B trees` and `B+ trees` are both types of self-balancing, sorted, tree-based data structures that maintain sorted data in a way that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. A `B tree` is a tree data structure in which each node has multiple keys and can be in more than two children nodes. Each internal node in a `B tree` can contain a variable number of keys and pointers. The keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees. One important aspect of a `B tree` is that every key in the node also appears in the parent node. On the other hand, a `B+ tree` is an extension of a `B tree` which allows for efficient traversal of data. In a `B+ tree`, data pointers are stored only at the leaf nodes of the tree, making every leaf node of a `B+ tree` a linked list. The intermediary nodes only use the keys to aid with the search.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

The highest level contains only one element, the maximum. Every element in the lists is connected by a link to the element of the same value in the list below. This structure provides a balance between the speed of binary search trees and the ease of implementation of linked lists, providing an efficient means for storing data while allowing fast retrieval, even within large sets of data.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

Indexes are created using a few database columns and are capable of rapidly locating data without scanning every row in a database table each time the database table is accessed. Indexes can be created using any combination of columns in a database table, reducing the amount of time it takes to find data.\n\nIndexes can be structured in several ways: Binary Tree, B-Tree, Hash Map, etc., each having its own particular strengths and weaknesses. When creating an index, it's crucial to understand which type of index to apply in order to achieve maximum efficiency. Indexes, like any other database feature, must be used wisely because they require disk space and need to be maintained, which can slow down insert and update operations.",

On the other hand, B+ tree index structure makes all records reside at the leaf level, with the internal nodes only containing key values.

Backtracking is often applied in problems where the solution requires the sequence of decisions to meet certain constraints, like the 8-queens puzzle or the traveling salesperson problem. In essence, it involves exhaustive search and thus, can be computationally expensive. However, with the right sorts of constraints, it can sometimes find solutions to problems with large and complex spaces very efficiently.\n\nLearn more from the following links:",
