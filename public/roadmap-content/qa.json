    "description": "The phrase \"fit for use or purpose\" sums up quality, which is incredibly difficult to define. It all comes down to fulfilling the requirements and expectations of the consumer in terms of the product's usefulness, design, dependability, durability, and price.\n\nAssurance is nothing more than a confident statement made about a good or service. It is the assurance that a good outcome is guaranteed for a good or service. It offers a warranty that the product will perform faultlessly in accordance with expectations or needs.\n\nQuality Assurance (QA) also known as QA testing is an activity to ensure that an organization provides the best product or service to the customers. QA testing of a software involves the testing of performance, adaptability, and functionality. Yet, software quality assurance extends beyond software quality; it also comprises the quality process used for developing, testing, and release of software products. QA relies on the software development cycle, which includes the management of software requirements, design, coding, testing, and release.",

The main goal of verification process is to ensure quality of software application, design, architecture etc. The verification process involves activities like reviews, walk-throughs and inspection.\n\nValidation in Software Engineering is a dynamic mechanism of testing and validating if the software product actually meets the exact needs of the customer or not. The process helps to ensure that the software fulfills the desired use in an appropriate environment. The validation process involves activities like unit testing, integration testing, system testing and user acceptance testing.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "title": "Responsive vs Adaptive",
    "description": "There are two approaches to ensuring a website is optimized for mobile, tablet, laptop and PC screens: responsive design and adaptive design. While both are intended to solve the same problem, they use different strategies.\n\nWhat is responsive design?\n==========================\n\nA website created with responsive design serves up the same site to every device, but that site is fluid and will change its layout and appearance based on the size and orientation of the device.\n\nDevelopers use CSS to ensure each page of the site can reformat based on the size of the user's viewport and only need to create one codebase for the site. They use something called breakpoints to tell the site when to adjust to accommodate different screen sizes.\n\nThe majority of new sites now use responsive, which has been made easier for less experienced designers and developers, thanks to the availability of themes accessible through CMS systems such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.\n\nResponsive design does not offer as much control as adaptive, but takes much less work to both build and maintain. Responsive layouts are also fluid, and whilst adaptive can and do use percentages to give a more fluid feel when scaling, these can again cause a jump when a window is resized.\n\nWhat is adaptive design?\n========================\n\nIn adaptive design, a different website layout is created for each device's screen. As it loads, the site recognizes the size of the screen and serves up the layout that was made for that viewport. In fact, you can create a different user experience for each of six common screen sizes from very small to very large: 320px, 480px, 760px, 960px, 1200px and 1600px.\n\nAdaptive is useful for retrofitting an existing site in order to make it more suitable for mobile phones. This allows you to take control of the design and web development for specific, multiple viewports. The number of viewports that you choose to design for is entirely up to you, your company, and your overall budget. It does, however, afford you a certain amount of control (for example over content and layout) that you will not necessarily have using responsive design.",

Due to the logical limitations of security testing, passing the security testing process is not an indication that no flaws exist or that the system adequately satisfies the security requirements.\n\nTypical security requirements may include specific elements of confidentiality, integrity, authentication, availability, authorization and non-repudiation. Actual security requirements tested depend on the security requirements implemented by the system. Security testing as a term has a number of different meanings and can be completed in a number of different ways.

When designing and developing a software solution, it is important to keep these distinctions in mind.

Vulnerability scanning can help identify outdated software versions, missing patches, and misconfigurations, and validate compliance with or deviations from an organization’s security policy.\n\nThis is done by identifying the operating systems and major software applications running on the hosts and matching them with information on known vulnerabilities stored in the scanners’ vulnerability databases.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Instead, it uses a simulated browser where it stores the HTML code and runs the JavaScript you may have in your HTML page. This means that an HTML page doesn’t need to be displayed, saving precious time that would otherwise be occupied rendering it.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
