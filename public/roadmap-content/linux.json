Essential for containerization, cgroups prevent containers from monopolizing host resources, ensuring system stability and performance. Use `cgcreate` to create groups, assign processes, and set resource limits effectively.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

In Linux, Docker containers share the kernel and use features like namespaces and cgroups for isolation. This provides less overhead than traditional VMs while enabling consistent deployment across environments.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
