    "description": "Cgroups (control groups) are a Linux kernel feature that organizes processes into hierarchical groups and limits their resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O). Essential for containerization, cgroups prevent containers from monopolizing host resources, ensuring system stability and performance. Use `cgcreate` to create groups, assign processes, and set resource limits effectively.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "Docker is an open-source containerization platform that uses OS-level virtualization to package applications with dependencies into lightweight containers. In Linux, Docker containers share the kernel and use features like namespaces and cgroups for isolation. This provides less overhead than traditional VMs while enabling consistent deployment across environments.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
