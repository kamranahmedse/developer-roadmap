With inadequate permissions, unprivileged users are able to make changes that would be beneficial or harmless to the Linux system.\n\nLet's have a look at an example:\n\n    -rwxr--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jan 1 12:00 filename\n    \n\nFrom the above example, the first character `-` indicates if it is a regular file(`-`) or directory(`d`). The following group of three characters(`rwx`) represents the permissions for the file owner. The next three characters(`r--`) represent permissions for the group and the last set of three characters(`r--`) represents permissions for others.\n\nThe `r` indicates that the file can be read, `w` indicates that the file can be written to, and `x` indicates that the file can be executed.\n\nThe permissions can be changed using the `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp` commands.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Meanwhile, `gzip` and `bzip2` are used for file compression, reducing the file size and making data transmission easier.\n\nTake a look at the following commands in use:\n\n    # To create a tar archive:\n    tar cvf archive_name.tar directory_to_archive/\n    \n    # To extract a tar archive:\n    tar xvf archive_name.tar\n    \n    # To create a gzip compressed tar archive:\n    tar cvzf archive_name.tar.gz directory_to_archive/\n    \n    #To create a bzip2 compressed tar archive:\n    tar cvjf archive_name.tar.bz2 directory_to_archive/\n    \n\nRemember, in Linux, archiving and compression are separate processes, hence `tar` to archive and `gzip`/`bzip2` to compress.

In containerization, ulimits prevent rogue processes from exhausting server resources and creating denial-of-service situations. Use `ulimit -a` to view current limits and `ulimit -n 1024` to set specific limits for optimal container performance and security.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
