    "title": "Pick a Language",
    "description": "You need to pick a programming language to learn the Computer Science concepts. My personal recommendation would be to pick C++ or C and the reason for that is:\n\n*   They allow you to deal with pointers and memory allocation/deallocation, so you feel the data structures and algorithms in your bones. In higher level languages like Python or Java, these are hidden from you. In day to day work, that's terrific, but when you're learning how these low-level data structures are built, it's great to feel close to the metal.\n*   You will be able to find a lot of resources for the topics listed in this roadmap using C or C++. You can find a lot of resources for Python and Java, but they are not as abundant as C++ and C.\n\nGiven below is the list of resources; pick ones relevant to the language of your choice.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Specifically, it denotes the upper bound of the growth rate of a function that relates the running time of an algorithm to its input size. It can be used to compare algorithms and determine which one is better.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

The algorithm works by finding the shortest path from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph. It does this by keeping track of the distance from the starting node to each node, and then choosing the node with the shortest distance from the starting node to visit next. It then updates the distance of each node from the starting node, and repeats the process until all nodes have been visited.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

The algorithm is as follows:\n\n*   Compute the prefix function of the substring.\n*   Traverse through the string and substring simultaneously.\n*   If the characters match, increment the index of both the string and substring.\n*   If the characters don't match, increment the index of the string by the value of the prefix function at the index of the substring.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

It is more rigidly balanced than red–black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval.

Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications, but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst-case guarantees; for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red–black trees, and the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees. In the version 8 of Java, the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns. The idea is that a table should be about a specific topic and that only those columns which support that topic are included. This limits the number of duplicate data contained within your database. This makes the database more flexible by eliminating issues stemming from database modifications.\n\nDenormalization is the opposite of normalization. It is the process of adding redundant data to a database to improve read performance. This is done by adding duplicate data into multiple tables to avoid expensive joins. This is done at the expense of increased storage and decreased write performance.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

These binary states correspond to the ON/OFF positions of transistors, which are the building blocks of logic gates (AND, OR, NOT). Numbers, characters, and instructions are broken into binary sequences (bits), and grouped into bytes (8 bits). Arithmetic operations like addition are performed through logic gates, which combine binary values. The CPU executes these calculations by following a fetch-decode-execute cycle. Complex calculations, such as handling decimals, use floating-point representation.

Primary memory or RAM is a volatile memory, meaning the primary memory data exist when the system's power is on, and the data vanishes as the system is switched off. The primary memory contains the data required by the currently executing program in the CPU.

The scheduling algorithm is chosen depending on the type of system and the requirements of the processes.\n\nHere is the list of some of the most commonly used scheduling algorithms:\n\n*   **First Come First Serve (FCFS):** The process that arrives first is allocated the CPU first. It is a non-preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Shortest Job First (SJF):** The process with the smallest execution time is allocated the CPU first. It is a non-preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF):** The process with the smallest remaining execution time is allocated the CPU first. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Round Robin (RR):** The process is allocated the CPU for a fixed time slice. The time slice is usually 10 milliseconds. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Priority Scheduling:** The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Multi-level Queue Scheduling:** The processes are divided into different queues based on their priority. The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Multi-level Feedback Queue Scheduling:** The processes are divided into different queues based on their priority. The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. If a process is preempted, it is moved to the next queue. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Highest Response Ratio Next(HRRN):** CPU is allotted to the next process which has the highest response ratio and not to the process having less burst time. It is a Non-Preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Lottery Scheduling:** The process is allocated the CPU based on a lottery system. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more",

    "description": "CPU Interrupts are a way for the CPU to communicate with the rest of the computer. They are a way for the CPU to tell the rest of the computer that it needs to do something. For example, if the CPU is running a program and it needs to read from the keyboard, it will send an interrupt to the keyboard to tell it to send the data to the CPU. The CPU will then wait for the keyboard to send the data and then continue running the program.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
