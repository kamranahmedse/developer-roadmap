In AI agents, REST APIs enable communication between the agent and external systems, allowing for data exchange and integration. The agent can use REST APIs to retrieve data from external sources, send data to external systems, and interact with other AI agents or services. This provides a flexible and scalable way to integrate with various systems, enabling the agent to access a wide range of data and services. REST APIs in AI agents support a variety of functions, including data retrieval, data sending, and system interaction. They play a crucial role in facilitating communication between AI agents and external systems, making them a fundamental component of AI agent architecture.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

They use “attention” to find which parts of the input matter most for each other part. This lets them learn patterns in language very well. When a transformer has been trained on a very large set of text, we call it a Large Language Model (LLM). An LLM can answer questions, write text, translate languages, and code because it has seen many examples during training. AI agents use these models as their “brains.” They feed tasks or prompts to the LLM, get back text or plans, and then act on those results. This structure helps agents understand goals, break them into steps, and adjust based on feedback, making them useful for chatbots, research helpers, and automation tools.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Once text is turned into these numbered tokens, the model can look up an embedding for each number and start its math. By working with tokens instead of full sentences, the model keeps the input size steady and can handle new or rare words by slicing them into familiar sub-pieces. After the model finishes its work, the numbered tokens are turned back into text through the same vocabulary map, letting the user read the result.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

New tokens push old ones out, like a sliding window moving over text. The window size sets hard limits on how long a prompt, chat history, or document can be. A small window forces you to keep inputs short or split them, while a large window lets the model follow longer stories and hold more facts. Choosing the right window size balances cost, speed, and how much detail the model can keep in mind at once.\n\nNew techniques, like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context transformers (e.g., Claude 3, Gemini 1.5), aim to extend usable context without hitting model limits directly.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

This helps cut down on loops like “very very very” or long blocks that echo the same phrase. A value of 0 turns the rule off, while higher numbers make the model avoid repeats more strongly. If the penalty is too high, the text may miss common words that are still needed, so you often start low (for example 0.2) and adjust.

A standard model depends on patterns it learned during training and often guesses the most likely next word. That works well for everyday chat, summaries, or common facts, but it can fail on tricky puzzles or tasks with many linked parts. Reasoning takes more time and computer power, yet it brings higher accuracy and makes the agent easier to debug because you can see its thought steps.

    "description": "Embeddings turn words, pictures, or other data into lists of numbers called vectors. Each vector keeps the meaning of the original item. Things with similar meaning get vectors that sit close together in this number space. Vector search scans a large set of vectors and finds the ones nearest to a query vector, even if the exact words differ. This lets AI agents match questions with answers, suggest related items, and link ideas quickly.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "title": "Understand the Basics of RAG",
    "description": "RAG, short for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a way to make language models give better answers by letting them look things up before they reply. First, the system turns the user’s question into a search query and scans a knowledge source, such as a set of documents or a database. It then pulls back the most relevant passages, called “retrievals.” Next, the language model reads those passages and uses them, plus its own trained knowledge, to write the final answer. This mix of search and generation helps the model stay up to date, reduce guesswork, and cite real facts. Because it adds outside information on demand, RAG often needs less fine-tuning and can handle topics the base model never saw during training.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "When you use a large language model, you usually pay by the amount of text it reads and writes, counted in “tokens.” A token is about four characters or three-quarters of a word. Providers list a price per 1,000 tokens. For example, GPT-3.5 Turbo may cost around $0.002 per 1,000 tokens, while GPT-4 is much higher, such as $0.03 to $0.06 for prompts and $0.06 to $0.12 for replies. Smaller open-source models like Llama-2 can be free to use if you run them on your own computer, but you still pay for the hardware or cloud time. Vision or audio models often have extra fees because they use more compute. When planning costs, estimate the tokens in each call, multiply by the price, and add any hosting or storage charges.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

The agent may clean the text, translate speech to text, resize an image, or drop noise from sensor values. Good perception means the agent starts its loop with facts, not guesses.

Ask for “O(n log n) sorting algorithms” instead of just “fast sorts,” or “HTTP status code 404” instead of “page not found error.” The right term narrows the topic, removes guesswork, and points the model toward the knowledge base you need. It also keeps the answer at the right level, because the model sees you understand the field and will reply with matching depth. Check spelling and letter case; “SQL” and “sql” are seen the same, but “Sequel” is not. Do not overload the prompt with buzzwords—add only the words that truly matter. The goal is clear language plus the exact technical labels the subject uses.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

The agent’s planner reads this definition to decide when to use the tool. Good tool definitions are precise and leave no room for doubt, so the agent will not guess or misuse them. They also set limits, like how many times a tool can be called or how much data can be pulled, which helps control cost and errors.

When the user asks a question, the agent turns the question into its own vector, finds the nearest chunks, and reads them. It then writes a reply that mixes the new prompt with those chunks. Because the data store can hold a lot of past chats, documents, or notes, this process gives the agent a working memory without stuffing everything into the prompt.

    "description": "Summarization or compression lets an AI agent keep the gist of past chats without saving every line. After a talk, the agent runs a small model or rule set that pulls out key facts, goals, and feelings and writes them in a short note. This note goes into long-term memory, while the full chat can be dropped or stored elsewhere. Because the note is short, the agent spends fewer tokens when it loads memory into the next prompt, so costs stay low and speed stays high. Good summaries leave out side jokes and filler but keep names, dates, open tasks, and user preferences. The agent can update the note after each session, overwriting old points that are no longer true. This process lets the agent remember what matters even after hundreds of turns.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

The agent may tag each memory with a time stamp and lower its importance as it gets older, or it may remove items that have not been used for a while, much like a “least-recently-used” list. Some systems give each memory a relevance score; when space runs low, they erase the lowest-scoring items first. Others keep a fixed-length sliding window of the most recent events or create short summaries and store those instead of raw details. These methods stop the memory store from growing without limits, cut storage costs, and let the agent focus on current goals. Choosing the right mix of aging rules is a trade-off: forget too fast and the agent loses context, forget too slow and it wastes resources or reacts to outdated facts.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

The result of that action is fed back, giving the agent fresh facts to think about. This loop repeats until the task is done. By showing its thoughts in plain text, the agent can be inspected, debugged, and even corrected on the fly. The clear split between thinking and doing also cuts wasted moves and guides the model toward steady progress.

It also saves new facts and task results so the next agent can use them.

You describe each tool with a short name, what it does, and the shape of its inputs in a small JSON-like schema. You then pass the user message and this tool list to the model. Instead of normal text, the model can reply with a JSON block that names the tool and fills in the needed arguments. Your program reads this block, runs the real function, and can send the result back for the next step. This pattern makes agent actions clear, easy to parse, and hard to abuse, because the model cannot run code on its own and all calls go through your checks. It also cuts down on prompt hacks and wrong formats, so agents work faster and more safely.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

You give it the user question, the passages the agent pulled from a knowledge base, and the final answer. Ragas then scores the answer for things like correctness, relevance, and whether the cited passages really support the words in the answer. It uses large language models under the hood, so you do not need to write your own scoring rules. Results appear in a clear report that shows strong and weak spots in the pipeline. With this feedback you can change prompts, retriever settings, or model choices and quickly see if quality goes up. This makes testing RAG systems faster, repeatable, and less guess-based.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Instead of dumping plain text, the agent writes logs in a fixed key-value format, such as time, user\\_id, step, and message. Because every entry follows the same shape, search tools can filter, sort, and count events with ease. Tracing links those log lines into a chain that follows one request or task across many functions, threads, or microservices. By adding a unique trace ID to each step, you can see how long each part took and where errors happened. Together, structured logs and traces offer clear, machine-readable data that helps developers spot slow code paths, unusual behavior, and hidden bugs without endless manual scans.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

When the AI reads this text, it follows the hidden instructions instead of its safety rules. The attacker might force the AI to reveal private data, produce harmful content, or give wrong advice. This risk grows when the AI talks to other software or pulls text from the internet, because harmful prompts can slip in without warning. Good defenses include cleaning user input, setting strong guardrails inside the model, checking outputs for policy breaks, and keeping humans in the loop for high-risk tasks.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
