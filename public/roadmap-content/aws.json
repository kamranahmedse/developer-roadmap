On the other hand, a **Private Cloud** is a type of cloud computing that delivers similar advantages to public cloud, including scalability and self-service, but through a proprietary architecture dedicated to a single organization. Unlike public clouds, which deliver services to multiple organizations, a private cloud is dedicated to the needs and goals of a single entity.

When a subnet is designated as public, it means an Internet Gateway is attached to it and thus instances within this subnet can easily communicate with the outside net. Each instance that you launch into a public subnet is automatically assigned a private IPv4 address and a public IPv4 address. These addresses don't change and remain with the instance, until it's stopped, terminated or replaced with a different address. This setup allows instances in the public subnet to communicate directly with the internet and other AWS services.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

ECS also integrates with AWS services like AWS App Mesh for service mesh, Amazon RDS for database services, and AWS Systems Manager for operational control.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
