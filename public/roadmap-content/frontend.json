    "description": "The Shadow DOM is a way to keep the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of a web component separate from the rest of the webpage. Think of it as creating a private little DOM (Document Object Model) inside an element. This stops styles and scripts from accidentally affecting other parts of the page, and vice-versa. It helps make code cleaner and easier to manage, especially for custom elements that you want to reuse. It's mainly for web components but can be used anytime you want to keep code self-contained.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "WebSockets enable real-time, two-way communication between a client and server over a single, persistent TCP connection. This is ideal for applications needing fast, low-latency data exchange, like online games or live data streams, as it avoids repeated HTTP requests. Most modern browsers support WebSockets, and it integrates with various programming languages and frameworks.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "Server-Sent Events (SSE) let a web server send live updates to a webpage. It uses a regular HTTP connection for a one-way stream of data from server to client. This is good for things like live chats or news feeds. It's a simple way to keep a connection open for updates and works in most browsers. The webpage listens for these events and acts on them.\n\nTo use SSE, the client must create an EventSource object and specify the URL of the server-side script that will send the events. The server can then send events by writing them to the response stream with the proper formatting.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
