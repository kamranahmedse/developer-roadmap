Another type of on-chain scaling would be a sidechain with two-way bridge to Ethereum, like Polygon.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "title": "Why it matters?",
    "description": "The nature of blockchain allows for trustless systems to be built on top of it. Users don’t rely on a centralized group of people, such as a bank, to make decisions and allow transactions to flow through. Because the system is decentralized, users know that transactions will never be denied for non-custodial reasons. This decentralization enables use-cases that were previously impossible, such as parametric insurance, decentralized finance, and decentralized organizations (DAOs), among a few. This allows developers to build products that provide immediate value without having to go through a bureaucratic process of applications, approvals, and general red tape.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
