In 1996, about a year later after the release, NetScape decided to rename it to JavaScript with hopes of capitalizing on the Java community (although JavaScript did not have any relationship with Java) and released Netscape 2.0 with the official support of JavaScript.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "title": "Variable Scopes",
    "description": "In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of a variable or how it can be used after it is declared. The scope of a variable depends on the keyword that was used to declare it.\n\nThe three types of Scope are Global Scope, Function Scope, and Block Scope. Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope with the `var` keyword. ES6 introduced `let` and `const` which allow Block Scope in JavaScript.\n\nGlobal Scope: Variables declared outside any function or curly braces '{}' have Global Scope, and can be accessed from anywhere within the same Javascript code. `var`, `let` and `const` all provide this Scope.\n\nFunction Scope: Variables declared within a function can only be used within that same function. Outside that function, they are undefined. `var`, `let` and `const` all provide this Scope.\n\nBlock Scope: A block is any part of JavaScript code bounded by '{}'. Variables declared within a block can not be accessed outside that block. This Scope is only provided by the `let` and `const` keywords. If you declare a variable within a block using the `var` keyword, it will NOT have Block Scope.\n\nLocal Scope: Local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions. Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed. `var`, `let` and `const` all provide this Scope.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

The only difference between `Object.is()` and `===` is in their treatment of signed zeros and `NaN` values.

    "description": "At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate. The expression `x = 7` is an example of the first type. This expression uses the `=` operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7. The expression `3 + 4` is an example of the second type. This expression uses the `+` operator to add `3` and `4` together and produces a value, `7`. However, if it's not eventually part of a bigger construct (for example, a variable declaration like `const z = 3 + 4`), its result will be immediately discarded `—` this is usually a programmer mistake because the evaluation doesn't produce any effects. As the examples above also illustrate, all complex expressions are joined by operators, such as `=` and `+`.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

A closure refers to a function along with its lexical environment. It is essentially what allows us to return a function `A`, from another function `B`, that remembers the local variables defined in `B`, even after `B` exits. The idea of closures is employed in nearly every other JavaScript program, hence, it's paramount for a JavaScript developer to know it really well.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "title": "Strict Mode",
    "description": "JavaScript's strict mode is a way to opt-in to a restricted variant of JavaScript, thereby implicitly opting out of \"sloppy mode\". Strict mode isn't just a subset: it intentionally has different semantics from regular code. Browsers not supporting strict mode will run strict mode code with different behavior from browsers that do, so don't rely on strict mode without feature-testing for support for the relevant aspects of strict mode. Strict mode code and non-strict mode code can coexist so that scripts can opt into strict mode incrementally.\n\nStrict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics:\n\n*   Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.\n*   Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.\n*   Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

For example:\n\n*   Making HTTP requests using `fetch()`\n*   Accessing a user's camera or microphone using `getUserMedia()`\n*   Asking a user to select files using `showOpenFilePicker()`\n\nSo even though you may not have to implement your own asynchronous functions very often, you are very likely to need to use them correctly.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Iterators are objects, abiding by the iterator protocol, that allows us to easily iterate over a given sequence in various ways, such as using the `for...of` loop. Generators, on the other hand, allow us to use functions and the `yield` keyword to easily define iterable sequences that are iterators as well.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
