It defines a set of rules and conventions through which systems communicate over a network. Key characteristics of REST include statelessness, client-server communication, cacheability, and a uniform interface. Understanding and applying these principles properly can help in designing robust, scalable, and high-performance APIs. REST principles revolve around resources and their manipulation to achieve desired outcomes. By following these principles, developers can ensure that their API design is in line with web standards, thus improving interoperability across different systems.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

It represents a unique method of developing software systems that focuses on building single-function modules with well-defined interfaces. Each microservice runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism (often HTTP resources API) to serve a specific business goal. This architecture allows rapid, reliable, and scalable deployment of large, complex applications. It facilitates the organization of the development team around independently deployable units, thereby enhancing productivity and speed. When designing an API, it's essential to adapt this model to get a flexible and scalable construction.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

The server sends updates to the client as they happen, providing real-time, efficient data synchronization.

In terms of API Design, building APIs in compliance with PCI DSS is crucial when processing, storing or transmitting credit card information. By adhering to these standards, not only can developers ensure safe and secure API endpoints but also build trust among users by safeguarding their sensitive financial data.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

In essence, it provides the mandate for protecting sensitive patient data. Any organization dealing with protected health information (PHI) must ensure all required physical, network, and process security measures are in place. In the context of API design, HIPAA compliance means structuring endpoints, data transmission, and storage methods that align with these crucial safeguards. This encompasses encryption, access controls, audit controls, and integrity controls. Hence, understanding HIPAA is fundamental for API designers working in the healthcare domain.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

It refers to the secure handling and transmission of personal data such as names, addresses, and credit card numbers, which APIs often deal with. In this context, APIs must be built under strict compliance with standards such as GDPR, HIPAA or PCI DSS, which regulate the protection of personal data. These standards ensure that personal data is not misused and that user privacy is respected. Any violations can lead to hefty fines and damage to the company's reputation. Understanding PII and designing APIs in accordance with applicable regulations is vital for a robust, secure, and compliant API design.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

It is a binary protocol that uses HTTP/2 as a transport layer. It is a high performance, open source, general-purpose RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. It's main use case is for communication between two different languages within the same application. You can use Python to communicate with Go, or Java to communicate with C#.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
