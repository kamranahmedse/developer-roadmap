Focus on one or more applications which fulfill a business need (business solution). Some high, but mainly low-level design.

Theoretically, architects should master fundamental design patterns, such as those detailed in _\"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\"_, which remain foundational for modern architecture. Advanced knowledge of patterns and anti-patterns, like those in _\"Enterprise Integration Patterns\"_, extends this understanding. Architects must also focus on quality measures, ensuring designs meet non-functional requirements like scalability, security, and adaptability.\n\nPractically, architects improve by experimenting with various technology stacks, gaining insights into their strengths and limitations. Exploring frameworks like Angular reveals real-world pattern applications, such as Observables, and fosters deeper understanding through hands-on coding. Attending user groups and engaging in communities, like those on Meetup, broadens perspectives and encourages curiosity, enabling architects to stay updated and continuously refine their craft.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Focus on what’s important by emphasizing **conceptual integrity** (sticking to consistent decisions for simplicity and maintainability) and **uniformity** (ensuring standards like naming conventions are applied consistently). Prioritize critical decisions early to avoid costly workarounds or project delays, using tools like the Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) model for prioritization. Stay within your scope of competence to maintain credibility, collaborate with peers, and clarify responsibilities within the architectural hierarchy.\n\nWhen making decisions, evaluate multiple options to ensure thorough analysis and foster stakeholder confidence. Comparing options based on measurable criteria, such as cost or feasibility, leads to better, fact-driven decisions. This process not only supports sustainable outcomes but also prepares you with strong arguments during discussions, ensuring alignment across teams and stakeholders.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

To achieve this, “shake” your solution by analyzing it from different perspectives and questioning its assumptions. After complex discussions, take a step back to review the big picture and refactor if needed, giving your brain time to process ideas. Apply the _divide and conquer_ method to break problems into smaller parts and validate their integration afterward. Finally, remember that refactoring is a valuable process to improve overly complex solutions, provided there’s adequate test coverage and stakeholder support.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

It involves clearly conveying ideas, structuring discussions effectively, and driving meetings. Tools like “UZMO — Thinking With Your Pen” can enhance visual communication skills. Public speaking, whether to small or large groups, requires practice and stepping out of one’s comfort zone. Tailoring communication to the audience is essential—developers focus on details, while managers prioritize cost and outcomes.

It does this by separating an application into three parts: Model, View, and Controller. The model holds the data, the view encompasses the user-interface, and the controller acts as a mediator between the two.\n\nModel-view-presenter, or MVP, was designed to ease automated unit testing and improve the separation of concerns in presentation logic. MVP is a variant of the MVC pattern, though differs in that it divides the application into the user-interface (view), data (model) and presentation logic (presenter). While the model and the view represent stay the same as in the model-view-controller pattern, the presenter differs from the controller in that it manipulates the model and updates the view.\n\nAnother variant of the MVC is the model-view-viewmodel pattern. The Model-view-viewmodel, or MVVM, separates the application into three core components: Model, View, and View Model. While the view and model represent all that they did in their parent pattern, the view model acts as a link between the model and view, retrieves data from the model and exposes it to the view through two-way data binding and can manipulate the model's data.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

To achieve the above, there are various BPM tools like PEGA, IBM BPM, Appian, etc. Basically these tools automate the processes through a robust process modelling and implementation.\n\nBPMN: Business Process Management Notations\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIts is a standard for representing business processes graphically. While modelling the process, the notations used are complied with BPMN (there are other like EPC, etc.). So BPMN is a standard notation that BPM consultants follow to model the business process. BPMN has versions and now BPMN 2.0 is the standard one.\n\nBPEL : Business Process Execution Language\n------------------------------------------\n\nProgrammers use BPEL to define how a business process that involves web services will be executed. BPEL messages are typically used to invoke remote services, orchestrate process execution and manage events and exceptions. BPEL is often associated with Business Process Management Notation. In many organizations, analysts use BPMN to visualize business processes and developers transform the visualizations to BPEL for execution.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "title": "Containers",
    "description": "Containers are a construct in which cgroups, namespaces, and chroot are used to fully encapsulate and isolate a process. This encapsulated process, called a container image, shares the kernel of the host with other containers, allowing containers to be significantly smaller and faster than virtual machines. These images are designed for portability, allowing for full local testing of a static image, and easy deployment to a container management platform.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
