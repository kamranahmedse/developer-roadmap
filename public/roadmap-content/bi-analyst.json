At its core, machine learning involves algorithms that can identify patterns in data and improve over time with experience. Key areas include supervised learning (where models are trained on labeled data), unsupervised learning (where models identify patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (where agents learn to make decisions based on feedback from their actions). Essential components also include data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation metrics, and the importance of avoiding overfitting.

Around it are **dimension tables**, which add details like product names, customer info, or dates. This layout forms a star-like shape.\n\nA snowflake schema is another way of organizing data. In this schema, dimension tables are split into smaller sub-dimensions to keep data more organized and detailed, just like snowflakes in a large lake.\n\nThe star schema is simple and fast -ideal when you need to extract data for analysis quickly.
