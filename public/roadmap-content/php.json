The syntax involves putting the intended type in parentheses before the variable. For example, if you wanted to convert a string to an integer, you'd use: `$myVar = \"123\"; $intVar = (int) $myVar;`. Here, `$intVar` would be an integer representation of `$myVar`. Remember, the original variable type remains unchanged.\n\nHere's an example of type casting in PHP:\n\n    <?php\n    $foo = 10;   // $foo is an integer\n    $bar = (bool) $foo;   // $bar is a boolean\n    ?>\n    \n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Instead of a fatal error, the PHP Null Safe Operator (indicated by ?->) allows null values to be returned safely, making your code more robust. Here's a quick example, consider $session?->user?->name. If $session or user is null, PHP will stop further execution and simply return null. This makes PHP more resilient when processing unpredictable data.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

They allow a block of code to be executed repeatedly based on a certain condition or until a specific condition is met. In PHP, there are four types of loops - 'while', 'do-while', 'for' and 'foreach'. The 'while' loop continues executing its nested code as long as the condition remains true. The 'do-while' loop executes a block of code at least once, and then either continues executing it or stops, based on the condition. The 'for' loop is often used when the number of iterations is known. The 'foreach' loop works with arrays and is used to loop through each key/value pair in an array. Here's a simple example of a 'for' loop in PHP:\n\n    <?php\n    for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {\n        echo $i;\n    }\n    ?>\n    \n\nIn this example, the loop will execute five times, with $i increasing by one each time, outputting the numbers from 0 to 4.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

They are defined using the define() function or the const keyword.

A constructor is a special type of method that automatically runs upon creating an object, often used to set property values or default behaviors. On the other hand, a destructor is a method that is automatically invoked when an object is due to be destroyed, perfect for cleanup activities. Here is a basic example:\n\n    class TestClass {\n      public $value;\n    \n      // Constructor Method\n      public function __construct($val) {\n        $this->value = $val;\n      }\n    \n      // Destructor Method\n      public function __destruct() {\n        echo \"Object is being destroyed.\";\n      }\n    }\n    \n    $obj = new TestClass(\"Hello World\");\n    echo $obj->value; \n    // Displays: Hello World\n    // And when the script ends, \"Object is being destroyed.\"\n    \n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

In PHP, properties are declared using visibility keywords (public, protected, or private) followed by a regular variable declaration, while methods are declared like functions but inside a class.\n\nHere is a simple example:\n\n    class Car {\n      public $color; // Property\n    \n      // Method\n      public function setColor($color) {\n        $this->color = $color;\n      }\n    }\n    \n\nIn this example, `$color` is a property and `setColor()` is a method.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

This concept allows the creation of more flexible and maintainable code, as it promotes code reuse. For instance, consider we have a 'Vehicle' class and we want to create a 'Car' class. Since cars are a type of vehicle, it would make sense for our 'Car' class to inherit from the 'Vehicle' class.\n\n    class Vehicle {\n      public $color;\n      function drive() {\n        echo \"Driving...\";\n      }\n    }\n    \n    class Car extends Vehicle {\n      function horn() {\n        echo \"Beeping...\";\n      }\n    }\n    \n    $myCar = new Car();\n    $myCar->drive(); // Inherits drive method from Vehicle\n    $myCar->horn(); // Unique to Car\n    \n\nIn the above example, the 'Car' class inherits the drive method from the 'Vehicle' class but also has an additional method, horn.

    "description": "Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming that PHP supports. It provides a mechanism to use one interface for different underlying forms, enabling different objects to process differently based on their data type. In PHP, polymorphism can be achieved through inheritance and interfaces. For example, you may have a parent class 'Shape' and child classes 'Circle', 'Rectangle', etc. They all can have a method 'draw' but with different implementations. It's not limited to classes; you can also use polymorphism with interfaces by implementing different classes with the same interface where each class will have different code for the same method.\n\nHere's a small sample code demonstrating the concept:\n\n    <?php\n    interface Shape {\n      public function draw();\n    }\n    \n    class Circle implements Shape {\n      public function draw() {\n        echo \"Draw a circle\";\n      }\n    }\n    \n    class Rectangle implements Shape {\n      public function draw() {\n        echo \"Draw a rectangle\";\n      }\n    }\n    \n    function drawShape(Shape $shape) {\n      $shape->draw();\n    }\n    \n    drawShape(new Circle());  \n    drawShape(new Rectangle()); \n    ?>\n    \n\nThis creates a scalable way to add more shapes, as you only need to follow the 'Shape' interface.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Every class, function, or variable under this declaration is a part of the namespace until another namespace is declared, or the file ends. It's like creating a new room in your house solely for storing sports equipment. This makes it easier to find your tennis racket, as you won't have to rummage around in a closet full of mixed items.\n\nHere's a quick example:\n\n    namespace MyNamespace\\SubNamespace; \n    function displayGreeting() {\n         echo 'Hello World!'; \n    } \n    \n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

For example, OPcache is an opcode caching system that improves PHP performance by storing precompiled script bytecode in memory, negating the need for PHP to load and parse scripts on every request.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

PHP automatically provides a garbage collector which cleans up unused memory, but understanding and managing your script's memory usage can result in better use of resources. For instance, `unset()` function can help in freeing up memory by destroying the variables that are no longer used. Here is an example:\n\n    $string = \"This is a long string that's going to use a lot of memory!\";\n    echo memory_get_usage();  // Outputs: 36640\n    unset($string);\n    echo memory_get_usage();  // Outputs: 36640\n    \n\nIn this code snippet, you'll notice that the memory used remains the same even when the `$string` variable is unset. This is because `unset()` only reduces the reference count of the variable in PHP's memory manager, and the memory will be cleared at the end of script execution. Avoiding unnecessary data storage and using inherent PHP functions, can help optimize memory management.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Optimizing this setting will prevent the PHP scripts from eating up all server resources. Similarly, adjusting the `max_execution_time` limits the time a script runs. Just ensure careful configuration since restrictive settings could lead to issues. Here's a simple example of how you might modify these parameters:\n\n    // Updating memory_limit\n    ini_set('memory_limit','256M');\n    \n    // Updating max_execution_time\n    ini_set('max_execution_time', '300');\n    \n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "PHP-FPM, or PHP FastCGI Process Manager, is a robust and efficient way to serve PHP applications. It dramatically improves the speed and processing efficiency of PHP apps by isolating each request, thus preventing jobs from interfering with each other. With PHP-FPM, your server can handle more simultaneous visitors without a slowdown. For example, to start using PHP-FPM with NGINX, you may include this configuration in your NGINX server block:\n\n    location ~ \\.php$ {\n        try_files $uri =404;\n        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;\n        fastcgi_index index.php;\n        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;\n        include fastcgi_params;\n    }\n    \n\nHere `$uri` is the incoming request and `fastcgi_pass` should be the location where PHP-FPM listens.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
