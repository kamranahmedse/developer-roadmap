In games, the server-side is responsible for the logic and rules of the game, data persistence, security, and synchronization of the game state among all connected clients. It essentially handles all processing that isn't done on the client-side. Code run on the server-side can be written in various programming languages, but it's often in PHP, Ruby, Python, .NET, Java, or JavaScript (Node.js).

During this communication, TCP ensures that data is not lost or received out of order by providing error checking mechanisms and a system for retransmission of lost data. Furthermore, to ensure efficient use of network resources, TCP implements flow control, congestion control and provides a means for hosts to dynamically adjust the throughput of the connection.",

The receiving system re-computes the checksum and compares it with the value sent along with the data. If both the computed values match, the data is assumed to be free from transmission errors. However, if the computed values don't match, TCP will detect a possible change in received data, and the receiver will request for the re-transmission of the lost or corrupted data packets.

It's essentially about how reliable the data transfer is over the network. IP itself is an unreliable protocol, meaning it doesn't guarantee the delivery of data packets. This is where protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) come in. TCP adds a layer of reliability to IP by ensuring the delivery of the data packets, ordering them correctly and error-checking. This ensures that game data synchronizes correctly across the server and clients without any loss, providing consistency and a smooth gameplay experience. However, the full guarantees of TCP come with some additional overhead; therefore, some games might prefer to use unreliable protocols when high performance is more critical than absolute reliability.",

By using semaphores, developers can optimize performance by preventing resource starvation and contention. Implementing them correctly requires careful handling to avoid deadlocks and ensure efficient thread scheduling. Commonly used in conjunction with mutexes and condition variables, semaphores help maintain stability in high-performance multiplayer environments.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

When the condition is met, another thread will notify the condition variable, prompt it to wake up a thread from the waiting queue, and relock the mutex.

This allows for tasks to be processed independently, making the most of system resources. When a function contains an operation such as I/O, database access, or network communication, which may take a long time to complete, this function is wrapped into a future or promise and sent for execution. Meanwhile, the core program continues to run. When the wrapped function gets executed, a callback function is used to notify that the computation or I/O is complete. This forms the core of non-blocking or asynchronous execution. It is widely used in server-side programming, game development, and any scenario where I/O latency or user experience is a concern.

    "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) in server side game development refers to the use of algorithms and computational procedures to create systems capable of performing tasks that would require human intelligence. Such tasks include learning and adapting to change, recognizing speech, or even making decisions. In game development, AI is often used to give non-player characters (NPCs) their own 'intelligence', making them even more life-like. This could be as simple as the ability to follow a player around in an environment, or as complex as crafting strategies for combat. AI can also be used to generate procedurally or dynamically generated content, creating potentially infinite unique experiences for the player. AI in games is often programmed in a way where it must strike a balance between appearing intelligent and providing an enjoyable experience for the player.",

    "description": "Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for decision-making. This technique utilizes multiple layers of algorithms (or neural networks) to process information. Deep learning involves training a model using large volumes of data and neural network architectures that contain many layers. A server-side game developer might use deep learning algorithms to create complex AI characters, improve game physics, or even analyze player data. Deep learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised and it's extensively applied in various domains such as voice recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, etc. It is a crucial element for many modern AI applications.",
