In games, the server-side is responsible for the logic and rules of the game, data persistence, security, and synchronization of the game state among all connected clients. It essentially handles all processing that isn't done on the client-side. Code run on the server-side can be written in various programming languages, but it's often in PHP, Ruby, Python, .NET, Java, or JavaScript (Node.js).

During this communication, TCP ensures that data is not lost or received out of order by providing error checking mechanisms and a system for retransmission of lost data. Furthermore, to ensure efficient use of network resources, TCP implements flow control, congestion control and provides a means for hosts to dynamically adjust the throughput of the connection.",

The receiving system re-computes the checksum and compares it with the value sent along with the data. If both the computed values match, the data is assumed to be free from transmission errors. However, if the computed values don't match, TCP will detect a possible change in received data, and the receiver will request for the re-transmission of the lost or corrupted data packets.

It's essentially about how reliable the data transfer is over the network. IP itself is an unreliable protocol, meaning it doesn't guarantee the delivery of data packets. This is where protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) come in. TCP adds a layer of reliability to IP by ensuring the delivery of the data packets, ordering them correctly and error-checking. This ensures that game data synchronizes correctly across the server and clients without any loss, providing consistency and a smooth gameplay experience. However, the full guarantees of TCP come with some additional overhead; therefore, some games might prefer to use unreliable protocols when high performance is more critical than absolute reliability.",

By using semaphores, developers can optimize performance by preventing resource starvation and contention. Implementing them correctly requires careful handling to avoid deadlocks and ensure efficient thread scheduling. Commonly used in conjunction with mutexes and condition variables, semaphores help maintain stability in high-performance multiplayer environments.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

When the condition is met, another thread will notify the condition variable, prompt it to wake up a thread from the waiting queue, and relock the mutex.

Containers can also communicate with each other, enabling more efficient use of resources.",

    "title": "Docker",
    "description": "\"Docker\" is an open-source platform that allows developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications. It uses containerization technologies to wrap up an application with its runtime environment into a container, which can then be run on almost any operating system. Docker containers are lightweight and fast because they do not need the extra load of a hypervisor, but run directly within the host machine's kernel. Additionally, Docker ensures that the application runs seamlessly in any environment by bundling its own software, libraries and system tools. Docker really simplifies the process of managing and deploying services in a distributed environment and breaking down tasks into separate services.",

The containers are defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file using a YAML format. This tool is primarily focused on the runtime aspects of your application such as service definitions, configuration, and connections. With `Docker Compose`, you can start, stop, and manage the entire stack of services with a single command. This makes it a very powerful tool for managing multi-container applications. It is also a good method to define a local development environment that mimics your production environment.",

The platform was originally developed by Google, drawing on their long experience with managing containerized applications. It groups an application's containers into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes offers features like automatic bin packing, horizontal scaling, automated rollouts and rollbacks, and storage orchestration, among many others. It supports a variety of underlying infrastructures, from physical servers to virtual machines and cloud-based deployments, allowing you to run your apps wherever and however you choose.",

    "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) in server side game development refers to the use of algorithms and computational procedures to create systems capable of performing tasks that would require human intelligence. Such tasks include learning and adapting to change, recognizing speech, or even making decisions. In game development, AI is often used to give non-player characters (NPCs) their own 'intelligence', making them even more life-like. This could be as simple as the ability to follow a player around in an environment, or as complex as crafting strategies for combat. AI can also be used to generate procedurally or dynamically generated content, creating potentially infinite unique experiences for the player. AI in games is often programmed in a way where it must strike a balance between appearing intelligent and providing an enjoyable experience for the player.",
