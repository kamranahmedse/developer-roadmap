Every browser has its own version of a JS engine, and node.js is built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, Google Chrome's core, outside the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant. A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.\n\nNode.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

In addition, in `package.json` file there will be a new line added for the installed dependency under the label `dependencies`. At this point - you can start using the package in your NodeJS code by importing the package. Unlike the local install, you can install packages and dependencies **globally**. This would install it in a system path, and these packages would be available to any program which runs on **this specific** computer. This method is often used for installing command line tools (for example, even `npm` program is a Globally installed npm package).\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Besides slowing down the development of the app, it also makes the writing dirty and creates unnecessary code. Finally, trying to log out variables alongside with the noise of other potential logging operations, may make the process of debugging difficult when attempting to find the values you are debugging.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
