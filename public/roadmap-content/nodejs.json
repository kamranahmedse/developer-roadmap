Every browser has its own version of a JS engine, and node.js is built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, Google Chrome's core, outside the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant. A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.\n\nNode.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

In addition, in `package.json` file there will be a new line added for the installed dependency under the label `dependencies`. At this point - you can start using the package in your NodeJS code by importing the package. Unlike the local install, you can install packages and dependencies **globally**. This would install it in a system path, and these packages would be available to any program which runs on **this specific** computer. This method is often used for installing command line tools (for example, even `npm` program is a Globally installed npm package).\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
