The concept of 'shift left' in DevOps refers to the practice of performing tasks earlier in the software development lifecycle.

This includes integrating testing, security, and other quality checks early in the development process rather than at the end. The goal is to identify and fix issues sooner, thus reducing defects, improving quality, and speeding up software delivery times.
