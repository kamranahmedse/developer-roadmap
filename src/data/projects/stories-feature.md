You are required to build a "Story" feature similar to those found in popular social media platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp. The goal is to allow a user to post short, ephemeral content that disappears after 24 hours. As this is a Frontend project this is going to be client-side only.

## Requirements

There will be a list of stories at the top and a plus button. Clicking the plus button will allow user to upload an image which will be converted to base64 and stored in local storage. The image will be displayed in the list of stories. The image will be removed after 24 hours. User should optionally be able to swipe through the stories.

## Constraints

- You can use any frontend framework to build this
- Feel free to use any libraries or tools you are comfortable with
- The project should be client-side only
- The project should be responsive
- Image dimensions should be constrained to a maximum of 1080px x 1920px

After building this project, you will have a better understanding of how to work with client-side storage, timeouts, and how to create a responsive design.
