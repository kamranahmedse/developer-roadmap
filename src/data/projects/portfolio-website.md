> The goal of this project is to teach you how to style a website using CSS. You will take the structure from the [previous HTML-only project](/projects/basic-html-website) and apply various CSS techniques to enhance its appearance and responsiveness.

In this project, you will style the HTML website structure you created previously [in a different project](/projects/basic-html-website). The focus will be on learning how to use CSS to create responsive layouts, apply color and typography, and enhance the overall design of your website.

Rough mockup of the website structure is given below. Do not worry about the design details i.e. colors backgrounds etc at this stage; we are not looking for a beautiful design, but a well-structured and responsive website. Just focus on making the layout same as the mockup and ensuring it looks good on different screen sizes.

- Consistent use of a chosen color scheme and typography.
- Proper use of CSS techniques like Flexbox, media queries, and the box model.
- A responsive navigation bar and well-styled contact form.

## Bonus Points

For bonus points, you can:

- Use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to enhance the typography of your website.
- Look into [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) to host your website for free.
- Add support for dark mode using CSS variables.
