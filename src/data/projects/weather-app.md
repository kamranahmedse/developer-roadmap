In this project you are required to build a weather app that displays the current weather details based on the location entered by the user. We will be leveraging a common weather API to achieve this.

You can use the 100% Visual Crossing Weather API - [here](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api)

## Requirements

- The User should be able to enter a location into an input field
- The User will be presented with temperature, wind speed, likelihood of rain, and general weather i.e. Sunny, Raining, Cloudy etc.
- The User will be shown the previous and future 24 hour periods.
- The weather outlook can be refreshed by the user.

## Stretch Goals

- Animation libraries such as framer can used to make the loading of weather more visually appealing
- The default weather view is the Users current location.
