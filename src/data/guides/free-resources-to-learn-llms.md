Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling machines to understand and generate human-like text. In my last visual guide, we discussed [what LLMs are and how they work on a high level](https://roadmap.sh/guides/introduction-to-llms). This guide is a curation of 5 free resources to help you further learn about LLMs and NLP. I have personally gone through these and would highly recommend these to anyone wanting to learn about LLMs.

## NLP Course by HuggingFace

[huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1)

HuggingFace, a leading NLP platform, offers an in-depth NLP course that delves into transformer models, their workings, and how to effectively utilize HuggingFace's models. The course starts with the basics of Datasets and Tokenizers, equipping you with essential knowledge before diving into classic NLP tasks. What sets this course apart is its broader perspective, exploring how transformer models can be applied in speech processing and computer vision domains. By the end, you'll have a strong foundation in using and fine-tuning models from HuggingFace.

## Prompt Engineering by DeepLearning.AI
