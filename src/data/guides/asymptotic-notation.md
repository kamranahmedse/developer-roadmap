Asymptotic notation is the standard way of measuring the time and space that an algorithm will consume as the input grows. In one of my last guides, I covered "Big-O notation" and a lot of you asked for a similar one for Asymptotic notation. You can find the [previous guide here](/guides/big-o-notation).
