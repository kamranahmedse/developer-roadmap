![Back-end engineer responsibilities](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/backend-engineer-responsibilities.jpg)

Typical projects that backend developers work on include:

- RESTful APIs that perform CRUD operations.
- Building web scraping and data processing services.
- Building image processing services.
- Designing and implementing content delivery networks (CDNs).
- Modeling and designing database systems.

Let’s look at their individual responsibilities in detail:

### Server-side development

This is one of the core responsibilities of a backend developer. It involves writing server-side web application logic to handle requests from the frontend, communicate with database systems, and handle an application’s business and backend logic.

### API development

A backend developer designs, implements, and maintains APIs for communicating between different services or parts of an application and with external systems. This involves creating endpoints, responding to requests, and ensuring API security. [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) is a standard tool used by backend engineers to design and document APIs.

### Database administration and management

Data plays a central role in software and application development. A backend developer decides how and where to store these data. Databases are one of the most used data storage solutions, and a backend developer designs and maintains them for efficient data management. The tasks here include deciding which databases to use, either [SQL](https://roadmap.sh/sql) or NoSQL databases, also known as document databases, choosing the right Object Relation Mapper (ORM) for mapping objects to a database, writing efficient queries, optimizing database performance, and ensuring data security.

### Performance optimization

Backend engineers continually look for ways to optimize performance. They identify performance bottlenecks such as slow database queries, poor code quality, and high application latency and work towards resolving them. This involves refactoring to ensure high-quality reusable code, updating dependencies, redesigning the database schema, etc.

### Integration of third-party services

Some applications integrate with third-party web services or APIs to perform specific tasks. Some of these third-party services include payment gateways, cloud services such as Google Cloud and [Amazon Web Services](https://roadmap.sh/aws), and user authentication services, such as Auth0. Backend engineers integrate these external services into an application.

### Testing and bug fixing

Backend engineers write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure system reliability. These tests help to keep the system *up* and bug-free during continuous development. Troubleshooting and fixing are also part of a backend engineer’s primary responsibility.

### Documentation

A backend developer writes and maintains technical specifications, API documentation, and guides for existing and new team members. These documents are forms of knowledge transfer and can be referenced when needed.

### Collaboration

Backend engineers collaborate with other team members, including frontend developers, UI/UX designers, project managers, product managers, etc., to achieve a common goal.

## Skills and qualifications needed to excel as a backend engineer

A backend engineer needs a combination of soft and technical skills to excel. Some of the skills you should look out for when hiring a backend engineer include:

- Collaboration and communication skills

### Knowledge of at least one backend programming language

A [backend developer](https://roadmap.sh/backend/developer-skills) should have an in-depth knowledge of at least one backend programming language, such as [Java](https://roadmap.sh/java), C#, [Python](https://roadmap.sh/python), [JavaScript (Node.js)](https://roadmap.sh/nodejs), etc. It is also beneficial for a backend engineer to be familiar with some backend frameworks such as Django, [ASP.NET](https://roadmap.sh/aspnet-core), Ruby on Rails, [Sprint Boot](https://roadmap.sh/spring-boot), etc.

![Backend languages](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/backend-languages.png)

### In-depth understanding of databases and caching

A backend developer should know how databases and caching work in robust web applications. Many types of databases are used in backend systems, including relational and document databases. Examples of Database Management Systems used in backend systems include Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.

[Caching](https://roadmap.sh/guides/http-caching) is a process of temporarily storing data that is requested regularly. It helps avoid recurrent unnecessary database queries. Redis is an example of an in-memory data store used for caching.

### Knowledge of APIs

APIs are used to communicate between different systems. These systems could be microservices, frontend and backend systems, or third-party systems. A backend developer is expected to know how to [design APIs](https://roadmap.sh/api-design) and make them available to consumers.

### Basic knowledge of web servers

A backend engineer should have a basic understanding of web server technologies. Web servers respond to client requests. An example of a web server is Nginx. During the interview process, you should ensure that the candidate understands how web servers work and also know how to configure them.

### Knowledge of design patterns

[Design patterns](https://roadmap.sh/guides/design-patterns-for-humans) are reusable code libraries or solutions to common problems in designing and structuring software components. A backend developer should know some of these design patterns. The common types of design patterns are:

- Creational patterns
- Structural patterns
- Behavioral patterns
- Architectural patterns

### Familiarity with version control systems

Version control systems help track and maintain a history of code changes made to an application. With a proper version control system, multiple developers can work on a codebase simultaneously. Through version control, they collaborate on a code repository.

A backend engineer is expected to have proficient knowledge of version control. Git is one of the most common version control systems today. There are many code repositories, including Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab.

### Understanding of security best practices

A backend developer should have a basic understanding of standard security practices and implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access to data. Common vulnerabilities include SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and cross-site request forgery. About every large cloud provider has features that provide security measures, including AWS IAM, Azure Active Directory, and Google Cloud Identity.

### Collaboration and communication skills

A backend developer typically collaborates with other engineers, managers, and testers across multiple teams to ensure consistency and improve user experience. During the interview process, you should pay close attention to the candidate's communication skills because a backend developer should be able to clearly communicate problems and their approach to a solution. Ask the candidate questions that border on collaboration and see how they respond.
