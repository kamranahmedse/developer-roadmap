## Core Frontend Technologies: The Trifecta

![Core Frontend Technologies](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/frontend-core-languages.png)

Every outstanding web page or web application begins with a strong foundation, and that foundation is built on HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

### HTML5

![HTML5](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/html5-w2rf5.png)

HTML (or Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of web development in the sense that it’s the standard all websites are built on and it’s going to be the skeleton of your user interface.
