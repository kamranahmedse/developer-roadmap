If you love uncovering patterns in data and using those insights to solve real-world problems, [data science](https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist) might be the right fit for you. On the other hand, if you're drawn to creating systems, writing code, and building the tools that power today's technology, [computer science](https://roadmap.sh/computer-science) could be your path.

From my experience working on projects in both fields, I've seen how they overlap and where they differ. As a data scientist, you'll focus on analyzing complex data using math, programming, and problem-solving skills. Your work might include building models to extract meaningful insights from data, enabling you to identify patterns, predict trends, detect fraud, or improve recommendations.

Computer science, in contrast, focuses on understanding how computing systems work. You'll write code, design algorithms, and develop programs to solve problems. You might create web applications and software tools or even dive into artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.

Although these fields overlap in areas like programming, they cater to different interests and career goals. In this guide, I'll walk you through what each field involves, the skills you need, and the opportunities they offer. By the end, you'll have the clarity to make an informed choice about your future based on which path suits you best.

## Data science vs. computer science: What are the key differences?

First, let's look at this table that summarizes the differences. Then, we'll discuss each one in more detail.

**Your primary focus**
The big difference between data science and computer science is their primary focus. If you choose data science, your role will involve extracting insights and helpful information from datasets. You'll use different tools and techniques to interpret and analyze data. The aim is to help businesses make data-driven decisions. Netflix, for example, uses machine learning and data science to learn your viewing history. Data scientists then analyze data to predict what shows you'll like and suggest movies.

In contrast, if you choose computer science, you'll focus on building computer systems to perform tasks. You'll create tools that make computers, web apps, data analysis, etc, work better. For example, a company like Google uses computer science to create algorithms that make search engines work. Computer scientists then create software systems and algorithms that will give you accurate results when you search online.

**Your career path**
Computer science and data science have very different career paths. As a data science professional, you'll use data to help make decisions and solve business problems. You'll work in various industries, like finance and healthcare, and take on roles such as:

- **Data analyst**: Collect and analyze data to help businesses make intelligent decisions. For example, as a data analyst in healthcare, you would use data analysis to know which treatments work best for a specific illness.
- **Data scientists**: Build predictive models to predict outcomes. As a data scientist in finance, you'll use data analysis to forecast how the stock market might go.
- **Data engineers**: Build and maintain data systems that enable data analysis.
- **Machine learning engineer**: Design and build machine learning models to solve everyday problems. As a machine learning engineer at a robotic car company, you'll create models to spot people, roads, traffic lights, and other cars. You'll be responsible for designing machine learning algorithms to help the car make fast decisions.

**Your key areas** **of** **specialization**
Data science focuses on machine learning, data mining, statistical analysis, and more**.** As a data scientist, you'll use these specializations to understand trends and make better decisions.

In contrast, computer science focuses on artificial intelligence, [data structures](https://roadmap.sh/datastructures-and-algorithms), and software development. As a computer scientist, you'll study these fields to create the tools that data scientists use.

**The** **tools and technologies** **you'll** **use**
Choosing data science requires using different tools and technologies to manipulate data. These tools include machine learning libraries **(TensorFlow)** and languages like [**Python**](https://roadmap.sh/python) **and R**. Python libraries like Pandas will help you with data manipulation and NumPy for math calculations. As a data scientist, you'll also use big data technologies like Hadoop to work with huge amounts of data.

On the other hand, computer science focuses on software development. As a computer scientist, you'll use programming languages like [Python](https://roadmap.sh/python), [C++](https://roadmap.sh/cpp), and [JavaScript](https://roadmap.sh/javascript) to create different web applications. You'll also use tools like [React](https://roadmap.sh/react), [Git](https://roadmap.sh/git-github), databases **(MySQL and** [**MongoDB**](https://roadmap.sh/mongodb)**)**, and IDEs **(VS code)** to write and test codes.

## What education do you need for computer and data science careers?

Getting a computer science degree gives you a solid foundation for software development. It will help you understand computer science principles and how to code and solve issues. Examples of these principles include programming languages, data structures, and operating systems. As a computer science graduate, you'll have a strong foundation that will help you land various tech jobs.

![Data science vs. computer science: Educational background](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/what-education-do-you-need-for-a-computer-and-data-science-career-xbujx.png)

Many universities offer specializations in data science within their computer science programs. Others treat data science as a separate program, recognizing it as a field in its own right. They teach you all about machine learning, data visualization, statistics, and more. These data science programs combine ideas from computer science, mathematics, and other fields. At the end of the program, you'll get a data science degree and the necessary skills to get a tech job.

Studying at a university is not the only way to get a data and computer science education. Many computer science students and aspiring data scientists attend boot camps and learn via certifications or online tutorials. For instance, you can find many [data science courses](https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist) on [roadmap.sh](http://roadmap.sh) and learn at your own pace.

Learning this way is more flexible and can work with all kinds of schedules and ways of learning. For instance, you can juggle work and study at the same time, which is much harder to do when you study at a university. If you go for a traditional degree like a data science degree, you'll need to invest more time, but you'll get a broad education.

With these educational paths in mind, a common question arises: **D\*\***o you need a computer science degree to pursue a career in data science?\*\* The answer is a simple no.

A computer science degree is not always required for computer and data science positions. It can help you start your career in data science, for example, by giving you a solid programming foundation. However, you can study other fields like mathematics, physics, and economics and still be a successful data scientist. You can also go through boot camps and online tutorials on data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization to gain the necessary skills.

Also, having some practical skills and constant practicing will give you more experience. When practicing, work on personal and open-source projects and build your portfolio to increase your chances of getting a job. Create time to attend meetups and [join online communities](https://discord.com/invite/cJpEt5Qbwa) to chat with other professionals.

## What are the essential skills you'll need?

Computer science and data science have a broad range of specialized skill sets. Some of these skills are relevant in both fields, and others are unique.
