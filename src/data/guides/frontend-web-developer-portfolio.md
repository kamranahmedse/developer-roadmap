## What do top web development portfolios have in common

Having a well-structured web development portfolio is crucial for showcasing your technical and web design skills to potential employers. While the template you choose may depend on factors like your intended role and work experience, all portfolios share some common elements to showcase:

- Personal brand
- Showcase skills and expertise
- Highlight live projects and contribution
- Build credibility
- Networking and opportunities

1. **Personal brand**: The portfolio should have a personal bio or summary that gives a clear representation of who the developer is.

2. **Showcase skills and expertise**: The portfolio should highlight the owner's competencies. Demonstrates proficiency in various technologies, frameworks, libraries, and tools used in [frontend](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) or [backend](https://roadmap.sh/backend) development. In addition, consider showcasing your professional certifications, companies worked for, and years of experience.

3. **Highlight project and contribution**: The portfolio should contain work or project sections to demonstrate real-world impact. It can also include community engagement, like open source projects, technical writing, and public speaking.

4. **Build credibility**: Web developer portfolios are one of the best ways to build brand and credibility. They allow you to showcase your professional image, provide proof of your work, and share testimonials from colleagues or previous clients.

5. **Networking and opportunities**: Portfolios are a great marketing tool for crafting a unique online presence and increasing visibility. They are useful during your job applications because they help you stand out to potential employers and are also ideal for showcasing the latest personal projects on professional networks like LinkedIn.

With the opportunities offered by a portfolio, it can sometimes become overwhelming to decide what to add and how to structure it, especially if you have extensive experience in frontend development, backend, and other web development areas. Let’s look at these aspects in detail.

## What makes a developer’s portfolio stand out from the rest?

A well-crafted developer’s portfolio is important for showcasing your technical skills and experience. We can narrow it down to essential features that every portfolio must have, and optional features that can help you stand out when applying for jobs or bidding on projects.

### Essential features

- **Introductory and About Me section**: This section should include a brief introduction about yourself, your background, and your expertise. It’s also a great place to include your name, location, and any other interesting details about yourself.

- **Skills and technologies section**: This section shows the different skills and proficiencies, such as crafting responsive designs, enhancing user experience, building APIs, and managing databases. It can also include [front end programming languages](https://roadmap.sh/frontend/languages), [frameworks](https://roadmap.sh/frontend/frameworks), databases, and other specialized skills.

- **Project section**: This section highlights your best work and can include demo links, GitHub links, screenshots, project overview, technologies used, and any other essential details.

- **Experience section**: This section shows your work history and highlights what you have done, including the timeline.

- **Contact section:** One of the main goals of having a portfolio is to attract potential clients or employers. It is crucial for anyone looking at your portfolio to easily contact you using any of the mediums like contact forms, email addresses, or social media links (like GitHub profiles, LinkedIn, or any other relevant links).

### Optional features

- **Theming**: Your portfolio can contain a theme switcher (dark and light modes) and color schemes to further personalize the visitors' experience.

- **Engaging animations** and engaging design can further enhance the visitor's experience, making your own portfolio stand out.

- **Testimonials**: References and appraisals from clients, colleagues, or managers that validate your skills and work ethic might be a valuable addition to your portfolio.

- **Blog**: Including guides, articles, blog posts, and other written content can help establish you as a thought leader and demonstrate your expertise and passion for the field, which can then boost your portfolio.

## What are the criteria for choosing a web developer portfolio template?

The number of templates available can be overwhelming, especially considering that more developers are open-sourcing their work. Questions like "**Should I clone a template and modify it?"**, **"Is accessibility and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) support available?"** **"Should I use a website builder?"** and many more may arise.

In this section, we will look at best practices and tips that will help you make the right decision. Here are the points to consider:

- Design and aesthetics
- Content layout
- Technical features
- Compatibility
- Cost and licensing
- User experience

### Design and aesthetics

The template should have a clean, modern, and professional design that captures your brand with consistent elements across all pages. Additionally, visual elements, such as colors, fonts, layouts, images, etc., should be customizable.

### Content layout

The portfolio template should have a dedicated section to easily access contact information, learn more about you, and showcase your work experience.

### Technical features

The template should have good SEO support, follow accessibility guidelines, be compatible with all major browsers, and support Open Graph tags (information previews) when shared on social media.

### Compatibility

If you intend to manage your portfolio content with a **Content Management System (CMS)**, leverage web development-specific libraries, or use cloud-based media storage to optimize media, choosing a template compatible with and supports desired tools and technologies is important.

### Cost and licensing

Ensure that the template you intend to use allows you to use it freely as you wish. Additionally, consider your budget, as templates range from free to premium.

### User experience

The template should be well-structured with a good sitemap, excellent information architecture, and intuitive navigation. It should also be responsive (like mobile devices) and have good loading speed.

Your personal portfolio usually crafts the first impression for potential employers and clients. Investing time in creating a well-designed, structured, and user-friendly portfolio that captures your experience is important.
