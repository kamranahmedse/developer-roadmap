Similarly, backend development utilizes server-side programming languages like Python, Ruby, Java, JavaScript (Node.js), and Go, along with frameworks such as Django, Ruby on Rails, Express.js, and Gin-gonic.

## Skill sets

A full stack developer has a wide range of skills that encompass both frontend and backend principles. They can work on user interface design, human-computer interaction, and client-side security, caching, queues, and system design. While full stack developers can touch all elements of an application, backend developers typically have deeper expertise in backend principles due to their focused specialization.

## Salary and job opening

Based on reviews of popular job posting platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor, Full stack developers have more job openings and higher average salaries as compared to backend developers.

## Learning curve

Backend development is relatively easier to learn because its core focus is on backend languages, libraries, frameworks, and other server-side development. In contrast,  full stack development combines both frontend and backend development, making it more challenging to learn.

While the points above cover the fundamental differences between full stack and backend development, it's worth noting that their roles and responsibilities can also vary depending on factors such as the organization, industry, and project scope.

Understanding each role and its responsibility is important. Let's look at those next.

## What is Full stack development?

The term "Full stack" refers to a developer who knows both the frontend and the backend of a web application. Full stack developers are versatile enough to handle all aspects of a web project, from constructing dynamic user interfaces that users can see and interact with to managing the server-side logic, database, and server management.

The following are some of the key aspects of full stack development:

- Frontend technologies
- Backend technologies
- Application Programming Interfaces (API) design
- Database
- Deployment
- Security
- Adaptability

## Frontend technologies

A deep understanding of frontend popular languages like HTML, CSS, and [JavaScript](https://roadmap.sh/javascript) is fundamental for building robust and scalable applications. Additionally, as a frontend developer, expertise in determining when and how to utilize frontend development frameworks and libraries like [React](https://roadmap.sh/react), [Vue](https://roadmap.sh/vue), [Angular](https://roadmap.sh/angular), and others is crucial for crafting dynamic applications that are responsive, accessible, and compatible across various browsers.

![html css and javascript](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/frontend-development-common-languages-25kzq.png)

## Backend technologies

Proficiency in server-side languages such as [Java](https://roadmap.sh/java), [JavaScript (Node.js)](https://roadmap.sh/nodejs), [Python](https://roadmap.sh/python), C#, [Go](https://roadmap.sh/golang), [Rust](https://roadmap.sh/rust), and their respective frameworks and libraries is essential for constructing scalable and robust services. Backend developers work behind the scenes, building the software required for the website and application user interface to be fully functional.

![Back end technologies](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/backend-programming-common-languages-oyd3s.png)

## Application Programming Interfaces (API) design

A [solid understanding](https://roadmap.sh/api-design) of designing, building, and implementing APIs is essential in full stack development. Additionally, knowing when to adopt different API protocols like REST, [GraphQL](https://roadmap.sh/graphql), WebSocket, and gRPC ([Google Remote Procedure Call](https://grpc.io/)) is also important.

![API design](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/application-programming-interfaces-design-dybns.png)

## Database

Determining whether to utilize a relational database management system like [PostgreSQL](https://roadmap.sh/postgresql-dba) or a non-relational database like [MongoDB](https://roadmap.sh/mongodb), opt for stored procedures, or an object-relational mapping (ORM) for data management are important decisions a full stack developer must address. Additionally, a good understanding of designing schemas and optimizing queries is also important.

## Deployment

The essence of building an application is to ensure that the target users can access it without restrictions and utilize it as intended. Full stack developers should understand deployment strategies and cloud platforms like [AWS](https://roadmap.sh/aws), Azure, and Google Cloud.

![Clouds deployment — AWS vs Azure vs GCP](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/clouds-deployment-nhvx3.png)

## Security

Exposing the application to the internet makes it susceptible to attacks. Therefore, familiarity with [security best practices](https://roadmap.sh/best-practices/api-security) and vulnerabilities is crucial to ensuring the integrity and safety of these applications.

![Web Security](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/web-security-6r9gg.png)

## Adaptability

Open-source and research activities have constantly changed the web development ecosystem. Full stack developers must be willing to learn new technologies, know when to build from scratch or use third-party solutions, and adapt to changing project requirements.

## What is Backend development?

Unlike full stack development, which combines the roles of frontend developers and backend developers to build applications, backend web development focuses solely on the server side. Backend developers handle tasks that occur behind the scenes and are not directly visible to users, including managing data, executing complex logic, and managing databases.

Backend development is divided into the presentation layer(which handles requests and responses), the business layer(which handles logic like calculation and data processing), and the data access layer (which handles database interactions). It uses server-side technologies similar to a full stack developer.

## Similarities between Full stack and Backend development

Full stack and backend development share several similarities as they both work on the server side of the application. Below are some key similarities in the web development process between full stack and backend:

- Both work on server-side functionality, such as business logic, database interaction, and data processing.
- Design and implement APIs to facilitate communication between software components.
- Both ensure the security and integrity of user data.
- Collaborate with other team members and business stakeholders to ensure project success.
- Both handle errors, edge cases, and other difficult technical aspects of the application.
- Both are involved in designing and architecting scalable systems.
## Web development in the modern era: Full stack vs Backend
