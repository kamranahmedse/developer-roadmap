# Terminology

Spring Core, the base of the Spring Framework, provides a model for configuring Java applications. Key concepts include **Beans** (Java objects managed by Spring), **Inversion of Control (IoC)** (Spring managing bean lifecycles and dependencies), and **Dependency Injection (DI)** (Spring providing bean dependencies). The **Spring container** (specifically an **ApplicationContext**) creates and manages these beans. Spring also offers **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** for handling cross-cutting concerns, an **event model** for decoupled communication using **ApplicationEvent** and **listeners**, abstractions for **Data Access** and **Transactions**, and utilities for **Task Execution and Scheduling**.
