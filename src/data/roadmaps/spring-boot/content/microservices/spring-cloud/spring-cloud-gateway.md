# Spring Cloud Gateway

Spring Cloud Gateway is a Spring Framework library for building API gateways. An API gateway is a service that acts as an intermediary between an application and a set of microservices. The API gateway is responsible for request routing, composition, and protocol translation, among other things. It can also perform tasks such as authentication, rate limiting, and caching.
