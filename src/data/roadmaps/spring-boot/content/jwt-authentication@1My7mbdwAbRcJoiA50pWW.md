# JWT Authentication

Spring Security can be used to implement JWT Authentication and Authorization to your APIs. The library provides a JWT-based authentication filter that you can add to your API endpoints. The filter will check the JWT that is included in the request header, and if it is valid, it will set the authentication information in the security context. You can then use the security context to perform authorization checks on the API endpoints.
