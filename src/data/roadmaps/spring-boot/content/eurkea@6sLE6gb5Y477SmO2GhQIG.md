# Eureka

Spring Cloud Eureka is a library for service discovery in a microservices-based architecture. Service discovery is a technique that allows services to find and communicate with each other, without having to hardcode their addresses.

Eureka is a service registry that allows service instances to register themselves and to discover other services by name. It provides a simple, consistent way for services to find and communicate with each other, and it integrates with other Spring Cloud libraries such as Ribbon and Feign to provide load balancing and declarative REST clients.
