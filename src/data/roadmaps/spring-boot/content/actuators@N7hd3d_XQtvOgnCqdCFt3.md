# Actuators

Spring Boot Actuators are a set of production-ready features in Spring Boot that allow you to monitor and manage your application in various ways. They provide a variety of endpoints that expose information about the health and performance of your application, and allow you to perform various management tasks such as shutting down the application or refreshing its configuration.

Spring Boot Actuators are typically used in production environments to monitor the health and performance of an application and identify any issues that may arise. They can also be used in development and testing environments to gain insight into the internal workings of the application.
