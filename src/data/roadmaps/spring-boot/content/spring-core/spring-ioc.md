# Spring IOC

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design pattern that is often used in conjunction with the Dependency Injection (DI) pattern. The basic idea behind IoC is to invert the flow of control in a program, so that instead of the program controlling the flow of logic and the creation of objects, the objects themselves control the flow of logic and the creation of other objects.

Spring is a popular Java framework that uses IoC and DI to provide a more flexible, modular approach to software development. The Spring IoC container is responsible for managing the creation and configuration of objects in a Spring-based application.
