# Servlet

A Spring servlet is a Java class that serves as the central point for handling requests and managing the lifecycle of the Spring IoC container. The Spring Framework provides a class called DispatcherServlet, which acts as the front controller in a Spring-based web application. When a user makes a request to a Spring web application, the DispatcherServlet is responsible for handling the request, delegating responsibility to other components, and ultimately returning a response to the user. The DispatcherServlet also manages the lifecycle of the Spring IoC container, including creating and initializing the container and making its beans available for use by other components in the application.
