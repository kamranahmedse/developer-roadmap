# Dependency Injection

Spring Boot uses the Spring Framework's Inversion of Control (IoC) container to manage objects and their dependencies. The IoC container is responsible for creating objects, wiring them together, and managing their lifecycle. When an object is created, its dependencies are also created and injected into the object.
