# Annotations

One of the key features of Spring Boot is its use of annotations, which are used to configure various aspects of the application and to enable certain features.

Some of the most commonly used annotations in Spring Boot include:

- `@SpringBootApplication`
- `@RestController`
- `@Autowired`
- `@Value`
- `@Enable`
- `@Configuration`
- `@Bean`

These are just a few examples of the many annotations that are available in Spring Boot. There are many other annotations that you can use to configure various aspects of your application, such as security, caching, and data access.
