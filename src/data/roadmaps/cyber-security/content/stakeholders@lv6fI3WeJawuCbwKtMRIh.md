# Stakeholders

Stakeholders are individuals, groups, or organizations with an interest or concern in a project, business, or initiative. They can affect or be affected by the organization's actions, objectives, and policies. In a business context, stakeholders typically include shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, government agencies, local communities, and sometimes competitors. Effective stakeholder management involves identifying key stakeholders, understanding their needs and expectations, communicating effectively with them, and balancing their often competing interests. Stakeholder engagement is crucial for project success, risk management, and organizational reputation. In IT and cybersecurity projects, stakeholders might include end-users, IT staff, management, compliance officers, and external regulators, each with distinct concerns regarding system functionality, security, and compliance.
