# WLAN

A Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) is a type of computer network that uses wireless data connections to link devices within a limited area. WLANs typically use Wi-Fi technology, allowing devices like laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices to connect to the internet or communicate with each other without physical cable connections. WLANs operate on radio frequencies, usually in the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands, and are set up using wireless routers or access points. They offer flexibility and mobility within the network's range, but require security measures like encryption (e.g., WPA3) to protect against unauthorized access and data interception.
