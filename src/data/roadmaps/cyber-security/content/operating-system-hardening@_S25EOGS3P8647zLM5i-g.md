# Operating System Hardening

**Operating system hardening** involves configuring and securing an OS to reduce vulnerabilities and improve its defense against attacks. This process includes disabling unnecessary services and ports, applying security patches and updates, configuring strong authentication mechanisms, enforcing least privilege principles, and enabling firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Hardening also involves setting up proper file permissions, securing system logs, and regularly auditing the system to ensure compliance with security policies and best practices. The goal is to minimize the attack surface and protect the OS from potential threats and exploits.
