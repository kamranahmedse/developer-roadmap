# NTP

**Network Time Protocol (NTP)** is a protocol used to synchronize the clocks of computers and network devices over a network. It ensures that all systems maintain accurate and consistent time by coordinating with a hierarchy of time sources, such as atomic clocks or GPS, through network communication. NTP operates over UDP port 123 and uses algorithms to account for network delays and adjust for clock drift, providing millisecond-level accuracy. Proper time synchronization is crucial for applications requiring time-sensitive operations, logging events, and maintaining the integrity of security protocols.
