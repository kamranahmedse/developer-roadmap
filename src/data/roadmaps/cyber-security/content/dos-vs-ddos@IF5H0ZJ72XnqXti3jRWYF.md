# Denial of Service (DoS) vs Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) are both types of cyber attacks aimed at disrupting the normal functioning of a targeted service, typically a website or network. A DoS attack involves a single source overwhelming a system with a flood of requests or malicious data, exhausting its resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users. In contrast, a DDoS attack amplifies this disruption by using multiple compromised devices, often forming a botnet, to launch a coordinated attack from numerous sources simultaneously. This distributed nature makes DDoS attacks more challenging to mitigate, as the traffic comes from many different locations, making it harder to identify and block the malicious traffic. Both types of attacks can cause significant downtime, financial loss, and reputational damage to the targeted organization.
