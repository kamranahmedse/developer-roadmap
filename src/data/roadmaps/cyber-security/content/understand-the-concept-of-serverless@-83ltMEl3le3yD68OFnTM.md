# Understand the concept of Serverless

Serverless computing is a cloud execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages server allocation, allowing developers to focus solely on writing code. It offers automatic scaling, pay-per-use billing based on actual compute time, and typically operates through event-driven, stateless functions designed for quick execution. Popular platforms include AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions. While serverless computing provides reduced operational complexity and cost efficiency, particularly for microservices and event-driven applications, it may face challenges with long-running tasks, cold starts, and potential vendor lock-in. Despite its name, servers are still involved, but their management is abstracted away from the developer, simplifying the deployment and scaling of applications.
