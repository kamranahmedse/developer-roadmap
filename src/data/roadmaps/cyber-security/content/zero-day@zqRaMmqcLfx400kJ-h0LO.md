# Zero Day

A zero-day vulnerability is a software security flaw unknown to the vendor and its developers, leaving it unpatched and potentially exploitable. When attackers discover and exploit such a vulnerability before the software creator can develop and release a fix, it's called a zero-day attack. These attacks are particularly dangerous because they take advantage of the window between discovery and patching, during which systems are highly vulnerable. Zero-days are prized in cybercriminal circles and can be used for various malicious purposes, including data theft, system compromise, or as part of larger attack campaigns. Defending against zero-days often requires proactive security measures, as traditional signature-based defenses are ineffective against unknown threats.
