# Basics of IDS and IPS

When it comes to cybersecurity, detecting and preventing intrusions is crucial for protecting valuable information systems and networks. In this section, we'll discuss the basics of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to help you better understand their function and importance in your overall cybersecurity strategy.

What is Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?
-----------------------------------------

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a critical security tool designed to monitor and analyze network traffic or host activities for any signs of malicious activity, policy violations, or unauthorized access attempts. Once a threat or anomaly is identified, the IDS raises an alert to the security administrator for further investigation and possible actions.

What is Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)?
------------------------------------------

An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is an advanced security solution closely related to IDS. While an IDS mainly focuses on detecting and alerting about intrusions, an IPS takes it a step further and actively works to prevent the attacks. It monitors, analyzes, and takes pre-configured automatic actions based on suspicious activities, such as blocking malicious traffic, resetting connections, or dropping malicious packets.
