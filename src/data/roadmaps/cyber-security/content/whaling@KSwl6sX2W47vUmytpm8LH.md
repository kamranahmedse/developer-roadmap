# Whaling

Whaling is a specific type of phishing attack that targets high-profile individuals within an organization, such as executives, CEOs, or other senior leaders. The term "whaling" is derived from the idea of hunting large "whales," as opposed to the more common "phishing," which targets a broader range of users. Whaling attacks are highly sophisticated and often involve personalized emails or communications that appear legitimate, making them difficult to detect.
