# ping

**Ping** is a network utility used to test the reachability and responsiveness of a device on a network. It sends Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request packets to a target host and measures the time it takes for an echo reply to be received. Ping is commonly used to diagnose network connectivity issues, determine network latency, and check if a specific server or device is online. A successful ping response indicates that the target device is reachable, while failures or delays may suggest network problems, such as packet loss or routing issues.
