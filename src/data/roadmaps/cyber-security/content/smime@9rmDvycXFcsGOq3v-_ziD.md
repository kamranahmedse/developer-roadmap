# S/MIME

S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a protocol for sending digitally signed and encrypted messages. It provides end-to-end encryption and authentication for email communications. S/MIME uses public key cryptography to ensure message confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation. It allows users to verify the sender's identity and ensures that the message hasn't been tampered with during transmission. S/MIME is widely supported by major email clients and is commonly used in corporate environments to secure sensitive communications. While it offers strong security, its adoption can be limited by the need for certificate management and the complexity of key exchange processes.
