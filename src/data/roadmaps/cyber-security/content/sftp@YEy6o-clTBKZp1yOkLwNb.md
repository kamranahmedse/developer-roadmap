# SFTP

SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a secure file transfer protocol that provides file access, transfer, and management over a reliable data stream. It runs over the SSH protocol, typically on port 22, ensuring encrypted file transfers. SFTP offers stronger security than traditional FTP by encrypting both commands and data in transit, preventing unauthorized interception. It supports features like resuming interrupted transfers, directory listings, and remote file system operations. SFTP is widely used for secure file transfers in various environments, from web hosting to enterprise data management, offering a more secure alternative to FTP while maintaining similar functionality. Its integration with SSH makes it a preferred choice for secure, authenticated file transfers in many network configurations.
