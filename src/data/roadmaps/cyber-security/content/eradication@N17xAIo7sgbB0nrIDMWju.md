# Eradication

Eradication in cybersecurity refers to the critical phase of incident response that follows containment, focusing on completely removing the threat from the affected systems. This process involves thoroughly identifying and eliminating all components of the attack, including malware, backdoors, and any alterations made to the system. Security teams meticulously analyze logs, conduct forensic examinations, and use specialized tools to ensure no traces of the threat remain. Eradication may require reimaging compromised systems, patching vulnerabilities, updating software, and resetting compromised credentials. It's a complex and often time-consuming process that demands precision to prevent reinfection or lingering security gaps. Successful eradication is crucial for restoring system integrity and preventing future incidents based on the same attack vector. After eradication, organizations typically move to the recovery phase, rebuilding and strengthening their systems with lessons learned from the incident.
