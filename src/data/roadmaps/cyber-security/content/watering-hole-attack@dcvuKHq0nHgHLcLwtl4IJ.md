Watering Hole Attack is a type of cyberattack where the attacker targets a specific group of users by compromising a website or online resource that they are known to frequently visit. The name "watering hole" comes from the idea of predators waiting by a water source to attack prey, similar to how attackers wait for their targets to visit a compromised site.
