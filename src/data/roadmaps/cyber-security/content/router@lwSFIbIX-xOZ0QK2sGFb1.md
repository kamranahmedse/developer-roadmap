# Router

A router is a networking device that directs data packets between different networks, ensuring they reach their destination. It operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and forwards data based on the IP addresses of the source and destination. Routers are essential for connecting devices to the internet or linking multiple networks together. They maintain a routing table to decide the best path for data and can dynamically update routes using protocols like RIP, OSPF, or BGP. Routers also handle Network Address Translation (NAT), allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP address. Many modern routers offer Wi-Fi for wireless connectivity and include basic firewall security to protect the network from threats.
