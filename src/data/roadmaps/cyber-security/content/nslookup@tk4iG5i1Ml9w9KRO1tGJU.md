# nslookup

**nslookup** is a network utility used to query Domain Name System (DNS) servers for information about domain names and IP addresses. It allows users to obtain details such as IP address mappings for a given domain name, reverse lookups to find domain names associated with an IP address, and DNS record types like A, MX, and CNAME records. nslookup helps troubleshoot DNS-related issues, verify DNS configurations, and analyze DNS records. It can be run from the command line in various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
