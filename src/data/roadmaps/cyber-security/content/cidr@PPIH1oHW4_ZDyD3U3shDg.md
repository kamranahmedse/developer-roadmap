# CIDR

CIDR, or Classless Inter-Domain Routing, is a method of allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets in a more flexible and efficient way, compared to the older method of Classful IP addressing. Developed in the early 1990s, CIDR helps to slow down the depletion of IPv4 addresses and reduce the size of routing tables, resulting in better performance and scalability of the Internet.

CIDR achieves its goals by replacing the traditional Class A, B, and C addressing schemes with a system that allows for variable-length subnet masking (VLSM). In CIDR, an IP address and its subnet mask are written together as a single entity, referred to as a _CIDR notation_.

A CIDR notation looks like this: `192.168.1.0/24`. Here, `192.168.1.0` is the IP address, and `/24` represents the subnet mask. The number after the slash (/) is called the _prefix length_, which indicates how many bits of the subnet mask should be set to 1 (bitmask). The remaining bits of the subnet mask are set to 0.
