This includes creating an incident response plan, defining roles and responsibilities, training staff, and ensuring that appropriate technologies, such as monitoring systems and logging tools, are in place to detect and respond to incidents. Preparation also involves conducting regular drills, threat intelligence gathering, and vulnerability assessments to enhance readiness, ensuring the organization is equipped to mitigate potential security threats quickly and efficiently.
