# Understand Common Exploit Frameworks

Common exploit frameworks are comprehensive platforms used for developing, testing, and executing security exploits. The most prominent is Metasploit, which offers a large database of known vulnerabilities and exploit modules. It allows security professionals to simulate attacks and test system defenses. Other frameworks include Canvas by Immunity, Core Impact, and the open-source BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework). These tools typically provide features for vulnerability scanning, payload generation, post-exploitation activities, and reporting. While primarily used for legitimate security testing and penetration testing, these frameworks can also be misused by malicious actors. Proper usage requires strict ethical guidelines, legal authorization, and a thorough understanding of cybersecurity principles and potential impacts.
