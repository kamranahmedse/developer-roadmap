# Understand Permissions

Permissions in computing systems define the level of access and actions allowed for users or processes on files, directories, and resources. They typically include read (ability to view content), write (ability to modify), and execute (ability to run programs or scripts) privileges. Permissions are fundamental to system security, data protection, and user management, controlling who can access, modify, or run specific resources. In Unix-like systems, permissions are often represented as rwx (read, write, execute) for owner, group, and others. Windows systems use Access Control Lists (ACLs) for more granular control. Proper permission management is crucial for maintaining system integrity, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations.
