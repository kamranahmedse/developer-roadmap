# ATT&CK

MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It provides a comprehensive matrix of attack methods used by threat actors, organized into tactics like initial access, execution, persistence, and exfiltration. This framework is widely used by cybersecurity professionals for threat modeling, improving defensive capabilities, and developing more effective security strategies. ATT&CK helps organizations understand attacker behavior, assess their security posture, and prioritize defenses against the most relevant threats.
