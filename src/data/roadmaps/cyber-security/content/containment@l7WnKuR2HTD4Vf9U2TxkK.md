# Containment

Containment in cybersecurity refers to the process of limiting the impact of a security incident by isolating affected systems, networks, or data to prevent further spread or damage. When a breach or malware infection is detected, containment strategies are quickly implemented to halt the attack's progress, often by disconnecting compromised systems from the network, blocking malicious traffic, or restricting user access. Containment is a critical step in incident response, allowing security teams to control the situation while they investigate the root cause, assess the extent of the breach, and prepare for remediation. Effective containment minimizes the potential harm to the organization, preserving the integrity of unaffected systems and data.
