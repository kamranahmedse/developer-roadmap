# False Negative / False Positive

A false positive happens when the security tool mistakenly identifies a non-threat as a threat. For example, it might raise an alarm for a legitimate user's activity, indicating a potential attack when there isn't any. A high number of false positives can cause unnecessary diverting of resources and time, investigating false alarms. Additionally, it could lead to user frustration if legitimate activities are being blocked.

A false negative occurs when the security tool fails to detect an actual threat or attack. This could result in a real attack going unnoticed, causing damage to the system, data breaches, or other negative consequences. A high number of false negatives indicate that the security system needs to be improved to capture real threats effectively.

To have an effective cybersecurity system, security professionals aim to maximize true positives and true negatives, while minimizing false positives and false negatives. Balancing these aspects ensures that the security tools maintain their effectiveness without causing undue disruptions to a user's experience.
