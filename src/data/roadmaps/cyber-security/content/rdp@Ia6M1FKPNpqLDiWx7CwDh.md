# RDP

**Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** is a Microsoft-developed protocol that enables users to remotely access and control a computer over a network. It allows users to interact with a remote desktop environment as if they were sitting in front of the computer, providing access to applications, files, and network resources. RDP is commonly used for remote administration, technical support, and remote work. It operates over TCP port 3389 and supports encryption for secure data transmission, though proper security measures, like strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, are essential to prevent unauthorized access.
