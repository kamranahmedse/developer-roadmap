WinHex is a universal hexadecimal editor and disk editor primarily used for computer forensics and data recovery. It allows users to examine and edit the raw content of files, disks, or memory in hexadecimal and ASCII formats. WinHex provides advanced features for data analysis, including disk cloning, secure data erasure, and file system reconstruction. It supports various file systems and can work with physical disks, disk images, and RAM. Forensic experts use WinHex to investigate digital evidence, recover deleted files, and analyze data structures. While powerful, it requires careful use as it can directly manipulate raw data, potentially causing unintended changes to critical system files or data.
