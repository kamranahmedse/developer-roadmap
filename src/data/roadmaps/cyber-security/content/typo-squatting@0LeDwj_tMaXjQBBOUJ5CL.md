# Typosquatting

Typosquatting is a form of cyberattack that exploits common typing errors made by users when entering website URLs into their browsers. Attackers create malicious websites with URLs that are very similar to legitimate ones, often differing by just a single letter, number, or symbol. When a user accidentally mistypes a URL, they may be redirected to the malicious site, where they can be subjected to phishing attacks, malware downloads, or other forms of cyber exploitation.
