# Bash

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a widely-used Unix shell and scripting language that acts as a command-line interface for executing commands and organizing files on your computer. It allows users to interact with the system's operating system by typing text commands, serving as an alternative to the graphical user interface (GUI). Bash, created as a free and improved version of the original Bourne Shell (`sh`), is the default shell in many Unix-based systems, including Linux, macOS, and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
