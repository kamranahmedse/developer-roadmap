# Basics of Computer Networking

Computer networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices to share data and resources. It involves the use of protocols like TCP/IP for communication, hardware such as routers and switches for directing traffic, and various network topologies (e.g., star, mesh, bus) for organizing connections. Networks can be categorized by size and scope, from small local area networks (LANs) to wide area networks (WANs) that span large geographical areas. Key concepts include IP addressing, subnetting, DNS for name resolution, and network security measures. Understanding networking basics is crucial for managing data flow, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and ensuring efficient communication in modern computing environments.
