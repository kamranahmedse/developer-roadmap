WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy): WEP is the oldest and least secure of the protocols listed. It uses a static 64-bit or 128-bit key for encryption, which is vulnerable to various attacks due to weak encryption and poor key management. It's considered obsolete and should not be used.

WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access): WPA improved upon WEP by introducing TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol), which dynamically changes encryption keys and provides better security. However, it still has vulnerabilities and is considered less secure compared to WPA2 and WPA3.

WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2): WPA2 introduced AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for stronger encryption, replacing TKIP. It provides improved security compared to WPA by using more robust encryption and authentication methods. It is generally considered secure but has some known vulnerabilities, especially in implementation.

WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3): WPA3 is the most current standard and offers enhanced security features. It uses SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) for more secure password-based authentication and improved encryption. WPA3 provides stronger protection against brute-force attacks and ensures better security for both personal and enterprise networks. It also includes forward secrecy, which helps protect past communications from future compromises.
