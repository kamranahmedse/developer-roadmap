# SaaS

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud-based model where software applications are delivered to users over the internet, eliminating the need for local installation or maintenance. SaaS providers manage infrastructure, security, and updates, allowing users to access the software on a subscription basis from any device with an internet connection. This model offers scalability, reduced upfront costs, and easy integration with other cloud services, making it a popular choice for businesses looking for flexibility and efficiency in software deployment.
