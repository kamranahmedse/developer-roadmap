# Google Workspace (Formerly G Suite)

Google Workspace, formerly known as G Suite, is a collection of cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools developed by Google. It includes popular applications such as Gmail for email, Google Drive for file storage and sharing, Google Docs for document creation and editing, Google Sheets for spreadsheets, and Google Meet for video conferencing. From a cybersecurity perspective, Google Workspace presents both advantages and challenges. It offers robust built-in security features like two-factor authentication, encryption of data in transit and at rest, and advanced threat protection. However, its cloud-based nature means organizations must carefully manage access controls, data sharing policies, and compliance with various regulations. Security professionals must be vigilant about potential phishing attacks targeting Google accounts, data leakage through improper sharing settings, and the risks associated with third-party app integrations. Understanding how to properly configure and monitor Google Workspace is crucial for maintaining the security of an organization's collaborative environment and protecting sensitive information stored within these widely-used tools.
