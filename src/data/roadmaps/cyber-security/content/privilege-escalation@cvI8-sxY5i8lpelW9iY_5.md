# Privilege escalation

Privilege escalation is a technique where an attacker increases their access level within a system, moving from lower to higher permissions, such as from a standard user to an administrator. This can be achieved by exploiting system vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or security weaknesses. It is critical to implement strong access controls, adhere to the principle of least privilege, and regularly update and patch systems to defend against such attacks.
