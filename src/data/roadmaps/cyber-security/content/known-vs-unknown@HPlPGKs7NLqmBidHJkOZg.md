# Known vs Unknown

"known" and "unknown" refer to the classification of threats based on the visibility and familiarity of the attack or vulnerability.

- **Known Threats** are those that have been previously identified and documented, such as malware signatures, vulnerabilities, or attack patterns. Security solutions like antivirus software and intrusion detection systems typically rely on databases of known threats to recognize and block them. These threats are easier to defend against because security teams have the tools and knowledge to detect and mitigate them.

- **Unknown Threats**, on the other hand, refer to new, emerging, or sophisticated threats that have not been previously encountered or documented. These can include zero-day vulnerabilities, which are software flaws not yet known to the vendor or the public, or advanced malware designed to evade traditional defenses. Unknown threats require more advanced detection techniques, such as behavioral analysis, machine learning, or heuristic-based detection, to identify anomalies and suspicious activities that don't match known patterns.
