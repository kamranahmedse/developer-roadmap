# Understand the concept of Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. It treats infrastructure configuration as software, allowing it to be version-controlled, tested, and automatically deployed. IaC enables consistent, repeatable environment setups, reduces manual errors, facilitates rapid scaling and disaster recovery, and improves collaboration between development and operations teams. Popular IaC tools include Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and Ansible, which use declarative or imperative approaches to define infrastructure states. This approach is fundamental to DevOps practices, cloud computing, and the efficient management of complex, dynamic IT environments.
