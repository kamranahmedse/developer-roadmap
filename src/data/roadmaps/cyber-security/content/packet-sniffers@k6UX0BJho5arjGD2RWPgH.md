# Packet Sniffers

**Packet sniffers** are tools used to capture and analyze network traffic by intercepting data packets as they traverse a network. They provide insights into network activity, including protocols, IP addresses, and payload contents, which can be useful for diagnosing network issues, monitoring performance, and detecting unauthorized or malicious activity. Packet sniffers operate in promiscuous mode, allowing them to capture all packets on a network segment, and are commonly used for network troubleshooting, security analysis, and forensic investigations. Examples include Wireshark and tcpdump.
