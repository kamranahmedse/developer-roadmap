# Replay Attack

A Replay Attack is a type of network attack where an attacker intercepts and retransmits legitimate communication data, often with the aim of gaining unauthorized access to a system or performing unauthorized actions. In this attack, the attacker captures a valid data transmission and then "replays" it later, without needing to decrypt or alter the data, to trick the recipient into thinking it's a legitimate request.
