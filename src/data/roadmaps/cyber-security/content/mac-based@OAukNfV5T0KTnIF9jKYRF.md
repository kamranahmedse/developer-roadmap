# MAC-based

**Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** is a security model in which access to resources is governed by predefined policies set by the system or organization, rather than by individual users. In MAC, access decisions are based on security labels or classifications assigned to both users and resources, such as sensitivity levels or clearance levels. Users cannot change these access controls; they are enforced by the system to maintain strict security standards and prevent unauthorized access. MAC is often used in high-security environments, such as government or military systems, to ensure that data and resources are accessed only by individuals with appropriate authorization.
