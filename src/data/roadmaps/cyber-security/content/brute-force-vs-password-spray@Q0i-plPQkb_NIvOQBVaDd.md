# Brute Force vs Password Spray

## What is Brute Force?

Brute Force is a method of password cracking where an attacker systematically tries all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found. This method is highly resource-intensive, as it involves attempting numerous password variations in a relatively short period of time.

## What is Password Spray?

Password Spray is a more targeted and stealthy method of password cracking where an attacker tries a small number of common passwords across many different accounts. Instead of bombarding a single account with numerous password attempts (as in brute force), password spraying involves using one or a few passwords against multiple accounts.
