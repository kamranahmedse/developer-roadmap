# Compliance

Compliance in cybersecurity refers to the adherence to laws, regulations, standards, and best practices designed to protect sensitive data and ensure the security of information systems. It encompasses a wide range of requirements that organizations must meet to safeguard their digital assets and maintain the trust of customers, partners, and regulatory bodies. Common compliance frameworks include GDPR for data protection in the EU, HIPAA for healthcare information in the US, PCI DSS for payment card industry, and ISO 27001 for information security management. Compliance often involves implementing specific security controls, conducting regular audits, maintaining documentation, and demonstrating ongoing commitment to security practices. While achieving compliance can be complex and resource-intensive, it is crucial for mitigating legal and financial risks, protecting reputation, and fostering a culture of security within organizations.
