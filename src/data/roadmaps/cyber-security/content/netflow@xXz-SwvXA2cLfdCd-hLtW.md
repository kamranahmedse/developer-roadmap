# NetFlow

**NetFlow** is a network protocol developed by Cisco for collecting and analyzing network traffic data. It provides detailed information about network flows, including the source and destination IP addresses, ports, and the amount of data transferred. NetFlow data helps network administrators monitor traffic patterns, assess network performance, and identify potential security threats. By analyzing flow data, organizations can gain insights into bandwidth usage, detect anomalies, and optimize network resources. NetFlow is widely supported across various network devices and often integrated with network management and security tools for enhanced visibility and control.
