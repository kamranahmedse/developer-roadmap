# LAN

A Local Area Network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers and devices within a limited area, such as a home, office, school, or small group of buildings. LANs typically use Ethernet or Wi-Fi technologies to enable high-speed data communication among connected devices. They allow for resource sharing, including files, printers, and internet connections. LANs are characterized by higher data transfer rates, lower latency, and more direct control over network configuration and security compared to wide area networks (WANs). Common LAN applications include file sharing, collaborative work, local hosting of websites or services, and networked gaming. The advent of software-defined networking and cloud technologies has expanded LAN capabilities, enabling more flexible and scalable local network infrastructures.
