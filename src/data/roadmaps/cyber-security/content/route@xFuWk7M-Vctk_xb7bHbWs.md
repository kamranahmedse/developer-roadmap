# route

The `route` command is a network utility used to view and manipulate the IP routing table on Unix-like and Windows systems. It allows users to display the current routes that data packets take, as well as add, modify, or delete routes for network traffic. This command is often used in network troubleshooting and configuration to control how data flows between different networks and subnets. By specifying routes manually, administrators can define specific paths for network traffic, bypassing default routes and optimizing performance or security.
