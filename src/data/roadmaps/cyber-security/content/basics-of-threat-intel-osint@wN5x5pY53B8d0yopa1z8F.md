# Basics of Threat Intel, OSINT

Threat Intelligence (Threat Intel) and Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) are both critical components in cybersecurity that help organizations stay ahead of potential threats. Threat Intelligence refers to the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information about potential or current attacks targeting an organization. This intelligence typically includes details on emerging threats, attack patterns, malicious IP addresses, and indicators of compromise (IoCs), helping security teams anticipate, prevent, or mitigate cyberattacks. Threat Intel can be sourced from both internal data (such as logs or past incidents) and external feeds, and it helps in understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of adversaries.

OSINT, a subset of Threat Intel, involves gathering publicly available information from open sources to assess and monitor threats. These sources include websites, social media, forums, news articles, and other publicly accessible platforms. OSINT is often used for reconnaissance to identify potential attack vectors, compromised credentials, or leaks of sensitive data. It’s also a valuable tool in tracking threat actors, as they may leave traces in forums or other public spaces. Both Threat Intel and OSINT enable organizations to be more proactive in their cybersecurity strategies by identifying vulnerabilities, understanding attacker behavior, and implementing timely defenses based on actionable insights.
