# MAN

A **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** is a type of network that spans a city or large campus, connecting multiple local area networks (LANs) within that geographic area. MANs are designed to provide high-speed data transfer and communication services to organizations, institutions, or businesses across a city. They support a variety of applications, including internet access, intranet connectivity, and data sharing among multiple locations. Typically, MANs are faster and cover a broader area than LANs but are smaller in scope compared to wide area networks (WANs).
