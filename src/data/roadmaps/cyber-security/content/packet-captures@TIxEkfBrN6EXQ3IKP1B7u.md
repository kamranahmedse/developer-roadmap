# Packet Captures

**Packet captures** involve recording and analyzing network traffic data packets as they travel across a network. This process allows network administrators and security professionals to inspect the content of packets, including headers and payloads, to diagnose network issues, monitor performance, and detect suspicious activities. Packet captures are typically performed using tools like Wireshark or tcpdump, which collect and store packets for later examination. This analysis helps in understanding network behavior, troubleshooting problems, and identifying security threats or vulnerabilities.
