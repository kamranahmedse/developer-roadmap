# Computer Hardware Components

Computer hardware components are the physical parts of a computer system that work together to perform computing tasks. The key components include the **central processing unit (CPU)**, which is the "brain" of the computer responsible for executing instructions and processing data. The **motherboard** is the main circuit board that connects and allows communication between the CPU, memory, and other hardware. **Random Access Memory (RAM)** serves as the computer's short-term memory, storing data that is actively being used by the CPU for quick access.

The **storage device**, such as a hard disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD), is where data is permanently stored, including the operating system, applications, and files. The **power supply unit (PSU)** provides the necessary electrical power to run the components. **Graphics processing units (GPU)**, dedicated for rendering images and videos, are important for tasks like gaming, video editing, and machine learning. Additionally, **input devices** like keyboards and mice, and **output devices** like monitors and printers, enable users to interact with the system. Together, these components make up the essential hardware of a computer, enabling it to perform various computing functions.
