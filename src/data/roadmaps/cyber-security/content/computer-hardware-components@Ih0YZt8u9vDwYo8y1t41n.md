# Computer Hardware Components

When it comes to understanding basic IT skills, one cannot overlook the importance of familiarizing yourself with the essential computer hardware components. These are the physical parts that make up a computer system, and understanding their functions will help you troubleshoot issues and maintain your device better. Here's a brief overview of some of the primary computer hardware components:

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The CPU serves as the heart and brain of a computer. It performs all the processing inside the computer and is responsible for executing instructions, performing calculations, and managing the flow of data.

**Key Points:**

- Considered the "brain" of the computer.
- Performs all the major processes and calculations.

## Motherboard

The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all components of the computer. It provides a central hub for communication between the CPU, memory, and other hardware components.

**Key Points:**

- Connects all other hardware components.
- Allows components to communicate with each other.

## Memory (RAM)

Random Access Memory (RAM) is where data is temporarily stored while the computer is powered on. The data is constantly accessed, written, and rewritten by the CPU. The more RAM a system has, the more tasks it can process simultaneously.

**Key Points:**

- Temporary storage for data while the computer is on.
- More RAM allows for better multitasking.

## Storage (Hard Drives)

Storage devices like hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD) are used to store data permanently on the computer, even when the device is powered off. Operating systems, software, and user files are stored on these drives.

**Key Points:**

- Permanent storage for data.
- Comes in HDD and SSD types, with SSDs being faster but more expensive.

## Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

The GPU is responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations on the computer screen. Its main function is to handle and display graphics, making your visuals smooth and responsive.

**Key Points:**

- Handles and processes graphics and visuals.
- Important for gaming, video editing, and graphic design tasks.

## Power Supply Unit (PSU)

The power supply unit provides the necessary power to all components in the computer. It converts the AC power from the wall socket into the DC power that the computer's components require.

**Key Points:**

- Provides power to all computer components.
- Converts AC power to DC power.

## Input/Output Devices

Input devices, such as a mouse, keyboard, or scanner, are used to interact with and input data into the computer. Output devices, like the display monitor and speakers, present information and data in a format we can understand.

**Key Points:**

- Input devices allow users to interact with the computer.
- Output devices present information to the user.

By understanding these essential computer hardware components, you can enhance your knowledge of how a computer functions and improve your IT troubleshooting and maintenance skills. Happy computing!
