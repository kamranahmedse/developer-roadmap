# XSS

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a common web application vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into content from trusted websites. These scripts execute in victims' browsers, potentially stealing sensitive data, hijacking user sessions, or defacing websites. XSS attacks come in three main types: stored (persistent), reflected (non-persistent), and DOM-based. Stored XSS permanently embeds malicious code in a server, while reflected XSS occurs when user input is immediately returned by a web application. DOM-based XSS manipulates the Document Object Model in the browser. Prevention strategies include input validation, output encoding, and implementing Content Security Policy headers to mitigate the risk of XSS vulnerabilities.
