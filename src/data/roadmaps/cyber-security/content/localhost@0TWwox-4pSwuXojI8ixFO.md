# localhost

**Localhost** refers to the standard hostname used to access the local computer on which a network service or application is running. It resolves to the loopback IP address `127.0.0.1` for IPv4 or `::1` for IPv6. When you connect to `localhost`, you're effectively communicating with your own machine, allowing you to test and debug network services or applications locally without accessing external networks.
