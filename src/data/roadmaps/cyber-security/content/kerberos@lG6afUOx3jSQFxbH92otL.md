# Kerberos

Kerberos is a network authentication protocol designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications. It was developed by MIT in the 1980s and is named after the three-headed dog from Greek mythology that guarded the gates of Hades, symbolizing the protocol's aim to provide secure authentication in a potentially hostile network environment.
