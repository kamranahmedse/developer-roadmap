# Basics of Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability management is the process of identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, and mitigating security vulnerabilities in an organization's systems, applications, and networks. It is a continuous, proactive approach to safeguarding digital assets by addressing potential weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. The process begins with **vulnerability scanning**, where tools are used to detect known vulnerabilities by analyzing software, configurations, and devices.

Once vulnerabilities are identified, they are **assessed and prioritized** based on factors such as severity, potential impact, and exploitability. Organizations typically use frameworks like CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) to assign risk scores to vulnerabilities, helping them focus on the most critical ones first.

Next, **remediation** is carried out through patching, configuration changes, or other fixes. In some cases, mitigation may involve applying temporary workarounds until a full patch is available. Finally, continuous **monitoring and reporting** ensure that new vulnerabilities are swiftly identified and addressed, maintaining the organization's security posture. Vulnerability management is key to reducing the risk of exploitation and minimizing the attack surface in today's complex IT environments.
