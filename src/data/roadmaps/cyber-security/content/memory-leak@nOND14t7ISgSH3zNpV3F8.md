# Memory Leak

A Memory Leak occurs when a computer program consumes memory but fails to release it back to the operating system after it is no longer needed. Over time, this can lead to reduced system performance, increased memory usage, and, in severe cases, the program or system may crash due to the exhaustion of available memory.
