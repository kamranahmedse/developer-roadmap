# Whishing

Whishing, a portmanteau of "wireless" and "phishing," is a cyber attack method that targets users of wireless networks, particularly public Wi-Fi hotspots. Attackers set up rogue wireless access points or compromise existing ones to intercept network traffic or redirect users to malicious websites. These fake hotspots often mimic legitimate ones, tricking users into connecting and potentially exposing their sensitive information. Whishing attacks can lead to theft of login credentials, financial data, or personal information. To protect against whishing, users are advised to avoid sensitive transactions on public Wi-Fi, use VPNs, verify network authenticity, and ensure HTTPS connections when browsing.
