# SRTP

SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) is a security-enhanced version of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) used for voice and video communication over IP networks. It provides encryption, message authentication, and integrity for RTP data in unicast and multicast applications. SRTP is designed to ensure the confidentiality of media streams and protect against eavesdropping, tampering, and replay attacks in Voice over IP (VoIP) and video conferencing systems. It uses AES encryption for confidentiality and HMAC-SHA1 for authentication. SRTP is widely used in secure communication applications, including SIP-based VoIP systems and WebRTC, to protect sensitive audio and video transmissions across potentially untrusted networks.
