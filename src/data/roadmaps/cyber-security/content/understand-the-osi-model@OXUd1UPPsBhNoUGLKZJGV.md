# Understand the OSI model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that describes how data communication occurs between devices in a network. It consists of seven layers, each with specific functions:

1.  Physical: Deals with physical transmission media
2.  Data Link: Handles error-free transfer between adjacent nodes
3.  Network: Manages addressing and routing
4.  Transport: Ensures end-to-end data delivery and flow control
5.  Session: Establishes, manages, and terminates connections
6.  Presentation: Formats and encrypts data for the application layer
7.  Application: Provides network services to end-user applications
