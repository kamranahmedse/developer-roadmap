# VLAN Hopping

VLAN hopping is a network attack where an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) configuration to gain unauthorized access to traffic on different VLANs. By manipulating VLAN tagging, the attacker can "hop" from one VLAN to another, bypassing network segmentation. This can be achieved using methods like switch spoofing or double tagging, allowing the attacker to intercept, alter, or reroute traffic within a network that was supposed to be isolated.
