# Event Logs

Event logs are digital records that document activities and occurrences within computer systems and networks. They serve as a crucial resource for cybersecurity professionals, providing a chronological trail of system operations, user actions, and security-related events. These logs capture a wide range of information, including login attempts, file access, system changes, and application errors. In the context of security, event logs play a vital role in threat detection, incident response, and forensic analysis. They help identify unusual patterns, track potential security breaches, and reconstruct the sequence of events during an attack. Effective log management involves collecting logs from various sources, securely storing them, and implementing tools for log analysis and correlation. However, the sheer volume of log data can be challenging to manage, requiring advanced analytics and automation to extract meaningful insights and detect security incidents in real-time.
