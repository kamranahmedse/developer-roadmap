# VLAN

A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is a logical segmentation of a physical network, allowing multiple isolated networks to exist on the same physical infrastructure. VLANs group devices together based on function, department, or application, regardless of their physical location. They improve network performance by reducing broadcast traffic, enhance security by isolating sensitive systems, and provide flexibility in network design and management. VLANs are configured on network switches using IEEE 802.1Q standard, which adds tags to Ethernet frames to identify VLAN membership. This technology is crucial for efficient network administration in large enterprises, data centers, and complex network environments.
