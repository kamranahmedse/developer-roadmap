# SOAR

SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) is a set of software solutions and tools that enable organizations to streamline security operations. It combines three key capabilities: orchestration of security tools, automation of repetitive tasks, and intelligent incident response. SOAR platforms integrate with existing security tools, automate workflow processes, and provide case management features. They help security teams respond faster to incidents, reduce manual workload, standardize response procedures, and improve overall incident management efficiency. SOAR solutions are particularly valuable in managing the high volume of security alerts in modern environments, helping prioritize threats and coordinate responses across multiple tools and teams.
