# Sinkholes

A sinkhole in cybersecurity is a method used to redirect malicious Internet traffic away from its intended destination to a designated server or IP address controlled by a security team or researcher. This technique is often employed to combat botnets, malware, and other cyber threats. By redirecting traffic to a sinkhole, analysts can monitor and analyze malicious activities, prevent further spread of threats, and gather intelligence on attack patterns. Sinkholes are particularly useful in disrupting command and control communications of botnets, effectively neutralizing their ability to receive instructions or exfiltrate data. This approach is a critical tool in large-scale threat mitigation and cyber defense strategies.
