As an incident responder, this utility can assist you in uncovering important evidence and preserving digital details to reconstruct the event timelines and ultimately prevent future attacks.

This command-line utility is available on Unix-based systems such as Linux, BSD, and macOS. It can perform tasks like data duplication, data conversion, and error correction. Most importantly, it's an invaluable tool for obtaining a bit-by-bit copy of a disk or file, which can then be analyzed using forensic tools.
