# Spam vs. Spim

Spam refers to unsolicited and often irrelevant messages sent over email, typically to a large number of recipients, with the purpose of advertising, phishing, spreading malware, or other malicious activities. Spam emails are usually sent by automated bots and are characterized by their bulk nature. Spim is a type of spam that specifically targets instant messaging (IM) platforms rather than email. Spim messages are unsolicited and typically used for advertising, phishing, or spreading malware. As instant messaging apps have grown in popularity, so too has the prevalence of Spim.
