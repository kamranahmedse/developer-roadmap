# Patching

**Patching** refers to the process of updating software or systems with fixes or improvements to address security vulnerabilities, bugs, or performance issues. This involves applying patches—small pieces of code provided by software vendors or developers—to close security gaps, resolve operational problems, and enhance functionality. Regular patching is crucial for maintaining system security and stability, protecting against exploits, and ensuring that systems remain compliant with security standards and best practices.
