# IaaS

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service that offers virtualized computing resources over the internet. Essentially, it enables you to rent IT infrastructure—such as virtual machines (VMs), storage, and networking—on a pay-as-you-go basis instead of buying and maintaining your own physical hardware.
