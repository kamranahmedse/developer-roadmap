# Tailgating

Tailgating is the act of getting access to a restricted area by simply following an authorized person. This is a common social engineering technique used by attackers to gain physical access to a building or a restricted area. The attacker waits for an authorized person to open the door and then follows them inside. This technique is effective because it is based on trust and the assumption that the attacker is an authorized person.
