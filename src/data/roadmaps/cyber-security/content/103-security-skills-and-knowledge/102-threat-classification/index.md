# Understand Threat Classification

Threat classification is an important aspect of cyber security, as it helps organizations identify, analyze, and prioritize potential cyber threats. In this section, we will discuss various types of threats, their characteristics, and the best practices to handle them.

## Types of Threats

There are several types of cyber threats that organizations should be aware of. Here, we will classify them into four main categories:

## Malware

Malware is the term used for malicious software designed to damage, exploit, or gain unauthorized access to a device, computer, or network. Common types of malware include:

- **Virus**: A self-replicating program that spreads by infecting files or disk drives and can cause various system disruptions.
- **Worm**: A self-replicating program which spreads through the network without user interaction.
- **Trojan**: A deceptive program that appears legitimate but contains malicious code or functions.
- **Ransomware**: A type of malware that encrypts user files and demands payment for their decryption.

## Phishing and Social Engineering

Phishing and social engineering threats involve manipulation or deception of individuals to reveal sensitive information or perform actions which benefit the attacker. Common types include:

- **Phishing**: The practice of sending fraudulent emails or messages pretending to be from a trusted source, with the intent of obtaining sensitive information or installing malware.
- **Spear-phishing**: A targeted phishing attack aimed at specific individuals or organizations.
- **Whaling**: A form of phishing targeted at high-level executives or decision-makers.
- **Social engineering**: The use of psychological manipulation to trick victims into providing sensitive information or access to their systems.

## Unauthorized Access

This threat category covers various methods of unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data, including:

- **Hacking**: Gaining unauthorized access to a computer system or network by exploiting security vulnerabilities.
- **Brute force**: Using trial-and-error methods to guess or crack passwords or encryption keys.
- **Privilege escalation**: Gaining additional privileges or permissions, typically by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks

DDoS attacks are attempts to render a computer system, network, or website unavailable by overwhelming it with a flood of malicious traffic. These attacks can be executed through various methods including:

- **Volume-based attacks**: Overloading the target with overwhelming amounts of traffic, such as UDP floods or ICMP floods.
- **Protocol-based attacks**: Exploiting weaknesses in network protocols, such as SYN floods or Ping of Death attacks.
- **Application-layer attacks**: Targeting specific applications, such as HTTP or DNS attacks.

## Best Practices for Handling Threats

- **Awareness**: Familiarize yourself and your team with common types of threats and their characteristics.
- **Prevention**: Implement measures to mitigate threats, such as regular software updates, strong passwords, and endpoint protection.
- **Detection**: Implement monitoring and detection tools to identify threats or suspicious activity.
- **Response**: Develop a response plan for handling incidents, including containment, remediation, and communication.

By understanding the various types of cyber threats and their characteristics, organizations can better protect themselves and their assets from potential attack. Regularly updating your threat classification knowledge and revising your security practices will ensure that your organization stays one step ahead of cyber criminals.
