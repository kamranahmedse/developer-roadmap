# memdump

**memdump** is a tool or process used to capture the contents of a computer's physical memory (RAM) for analysis. This "memory dump" can be useful in digital forensics, debugging, or incident response to identify active processes, open files, network connections, or potentially malicious code running in memory. By analyzing a memory dump, security professionals can investigate malware, recover encryption keys, or gather evidence in case of a breach. Tools like `memdump` (Linux utility) or `DumpIt` (Windows) are commonly used to perform this process.
