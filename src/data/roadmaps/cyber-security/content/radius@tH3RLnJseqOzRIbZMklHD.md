# RADIUS

**Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)** is a network protocol that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for users who connect to and use a network service. It is commonly used for managing access to network resources such as VPNs, Wi-Fi, and dial-up services. RADIUS servers validate user credentials, enforce access policies, and log user activities. It operates over UDP ports 1812 (authentication) and 1813 (accounting), and supports encryption for securely transmitting user credentials and data.
