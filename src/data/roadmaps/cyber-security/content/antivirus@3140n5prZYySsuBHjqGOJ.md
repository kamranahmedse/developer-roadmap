# Antivirus

Antivirus software is a specialized program designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software, such as viruses, worms, and trojans, from computer systems. It works by scanning files and programs for known malware signatures, monitoring system behavior for suspicious activity, and providing real-time protection against potential threats. Regular updates are essential for antivirus software to recognize and defend against the latest threats. While it is a critical component of cybersecurity, antivirus solutions are often part of a broader security strategy that includes firewalls, anti-malware tools, and user education to protect against a wide range of cyber threats.
