# Human Resources (HR)

Human Resources (HR) plays a crucial role in an organization's cybersecurity efforts, bridging the gap between people and technology. HR is responsible for developing and implementing policies that promote a security-conscious culture, including acceptable use policies, security awareness training, and insider threat prevention programs. They manage the employee lifecycle, from secure onboarding processes that include background checks and security clearances, to offboarding procedures that ensure proper revocation of access rights. HR collaborates with IT and security teams to define job roles and responsibilities related to data access, helping to enforce the principle of least privilege. They also handle sensitive employee data, making HR systems potential targets for cyber attacks. As such, HR professionals need to be well-versed in data protection regulations and best practices for safeguarding personal information. By fostering a security-minded workforce and aligning human capital management with cybersecurity objectives, HR significantly contributes to an organization's overall security posture.
