A legal department within an organization is responsible for handling all legal matters that affect the business, ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, and providing advice on various legal issues. Its primary functions include managing contracts, intellectual property, employment law, and regulatory compliance, as well as addressing disputes, litigation, and risk management. The legal department also plays a crucial role in corporate governance, ensuring that the company operates within the boundaries of the law while minimizing legal risks. In some cases, they work with external legal counsel for specialized legal matters, such as mergers and acquisitions or complex litigation.
