# NAC-based

Network Access Control (NAC) based hardening is a crucial component in enhancing the security of your network infrastructure. NAC provides organizations with the ability to control and manage access to the network resources, ensuring that only authorized users and devices can connect to the network. It plays a vital role in reducing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources. By implementing NAC-based hardening in your cybersecurity strategy, you protect your organization from threats and maintain secure access to critical resources.
