# NMAP

**Nmap** (Network Mapper) is an open-source network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a network, identify open ports, and detect vulnerabilities. It provides detailed information about networked devices, including their IP addresses, operating systems, and running services. Nmap supports various scanning techniques such as TCP SYN scan, UDP scan, and service version detection. It's widely used for network security assessments, vulnerability scanning, and network inventory management, helping administrators and security professionals understand and secure their network environments.
