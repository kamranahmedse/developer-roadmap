# Firewalls & Next-Generation Firewalls

Firewalls are network security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules. Traditional firewalls operate at the network layer, filtering traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. They provide basic protection by creating a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks.

Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) build upon this foundation, offering more advanced features to address modern cyber threats. NGFWs incorporate deep packet inspection, application-level filtering, and integrated intrusion prevention systems. They can identify and control applications regardless of port or protocol, enabling more granular security policies. NGFWs often include additional security functions such as SSL/TLS inspection, antivirus scanning, and threat intelligence integration. This evolution allows for more comprehensive network protection, better visibility into network traffic, and improved defense against sophisticated attacks in today's complex and dynamic threat landscape.
