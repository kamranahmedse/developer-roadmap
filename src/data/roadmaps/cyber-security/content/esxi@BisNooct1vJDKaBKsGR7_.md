# ESXi

VMware ESXi is a Type 1 hypervisor and the core building block for VMware's virtualization technology. It represents a bare-metal hypervisor, which means it is installed directly onto your physical server's hardware, without the need for a supporting operating system. This results in elevated performance, reduced overhead, and efficient resource allocation.
