# Buffer Overflow

A Buffer Overflow is a type of vulnerability that occurs when a program or process attempts to write more data to a buffer—a temporary storage area in memory—than it can hold. This overflow can cause the extra data to overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to unintended behavior, crashes, or security breaches.
