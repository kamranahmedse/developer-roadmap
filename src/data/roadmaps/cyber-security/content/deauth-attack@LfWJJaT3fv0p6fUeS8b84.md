# Deauth Attack

A Deauthentication (Deauth) Attack is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack specific to wireless networks. It involves sending fake deauthentication frames to a Wi-Fi client or access point, forcing the client to disconnect from the network. The attacker uses this technique to disrupt the communication between the client and the access point, often with the intention of capturing data, launching further attacks, or simply causing disruption.
