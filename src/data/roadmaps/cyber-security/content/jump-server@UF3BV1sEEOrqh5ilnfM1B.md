# Jump Server

A **jump server**, also known as a **bastion host** or **jump host**, is a critical security component in many network architectures. It is a dedicated, locked-down, and secure server that sits within a protected network, and provides a controlled access point for users and administrators to access specific components within the system. This intermediate server acts as a bridge between untrusted networks and the internal privileged systems, thereby reducing the attack surface and securing the environment.
