# SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure remote login and other secure network services over an unsecured network. It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by using strong encryption to protect the connection against eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks. SSH is commonly used for remote command-line login, remote command execution, and secure file transfers. It typically runs on TCP port 22 and replaces older, less secure protocols like Telnet. SSH uses public-key cryptography for authentication and supports various authentication methods, including passwords and key-based authentication. It's a fundamental tool for system administrators, developers, and anyone requiring secure remote access to systems.
