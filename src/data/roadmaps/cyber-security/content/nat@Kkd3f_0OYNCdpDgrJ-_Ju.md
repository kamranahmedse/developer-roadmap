# NAT

**Network Address Translation (NAT)** is a method used to modify IP address information in packet headers while they are in transit across a network. NAT allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address for accessing external resources, helping conserve the limited number of available public IP addresses. It also enhances security by hiding internal IP addresses from the public internet. Common types of NAT include **Static NAT** (one-to-one mapping), **Dynamic NAT** (many-to-many mapping), and **Port Address Translation (PAT)** or **NAT overload** (many-to-one mapping, commonly used in home routers).
