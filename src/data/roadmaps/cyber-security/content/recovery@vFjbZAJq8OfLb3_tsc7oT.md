# Recovery

The recovery phase of incident response focuses on restoring affected systems and services to normal operation, which involves repairing systems, recovering data from backups, validating functionality, and communicating with stakeholders. This phase also includes conducting a post-incident review to document lessons learned and update response plans to improve future preparedness. The aim is to minimize downtime, ensure data integrity, and return to normal operations efficiently.
