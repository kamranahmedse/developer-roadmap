# File Transfer Protocol (FTP) vs Secure File Transfer Protol (SFTP)

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) are both used for transferring files over networks, but they differ significantly in terms of security. FTP is an older protocol that transmits data in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access. It typically uses separate connections for commands and data transfer, operating on ports 20 and 21. SFTP, on the other hand, is a secure version that runs over the SSH protocol, encrypting both authentication credentials and file transfers. It uses a single connection on port 22, providing better firewall compatibility. SFTP offers stronger authentication methods and integrity checking, making it the preferred choice for secure file transfers in modern networks. While FTP is simpler and may be faster in some scenarios, its lack of built-in encryption makes it unsuitable for transmitting sensitive information, leading many organizations to adopt SFTP or other secure alternatives to protect their data during transit.
