# Hybrid

Hybrid cloud architecture combines elements of both public and private cloud environments, allowing organizations to leverage the benefits of each while maintaining flexibility and control. This model enables businesses to keep sensitive data and critical applications in a private cloud or on-premises infrastructure while utilizing public cloud resources for less sensitive operations or to handle peak demand. From a cybersecurity perspective, hybrid clouds present unique challenges and opportunities. They require careful management of data flow between environments, robust identity and access management across multiple platforms, and consistent security policies. The complexity of hybrid setups can increase the attack surface, necessitating advanced security tools and practices such as cloud access security brokers (CASBs) and multi-factor authentication. However, hybrid clouds also offer advantages like the ability to implement data residency requirements and maintain greater control over critical assets. Effective security in hybrid environments demands a holistic approach, encompassing cloud-native security tools, traditional security measures, and strong governance to ensure seamless protection across all infrastructure components.
