# APT

Advanced Persistent Threats, or APTs, are a class of cyber threats characterized by their persistence over a long period, extensive resources, and high level of sophistication. Often associated with nation-state actors, organized cybercrime groups, and well-funded hackers, APTs are primarily focused on targeting high-value assets, such as critical infrastructure, financial systems, and government agencies.
