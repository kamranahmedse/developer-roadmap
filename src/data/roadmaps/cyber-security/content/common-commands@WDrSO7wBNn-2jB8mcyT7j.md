# Common Commands

Common operating system (OS) commands are essential for interacting with a system's shell or command-line interface (CLI). These commands allow users to perform a wide range of tasks, such as navigating the file system, managing files and directories, checking system status, and administering processes. Below are some commonly used commands across Unix/Linux and Windows operating systems:

1. **Navigating the File System:**
   - Unix/Linux: `ls` (list files), `cd` (change directory), `pwd` (print working directory)
   - Windows: `dir` (list files), `cd` (change directory), `echo %cd%` (print working directory)

2. **File and Directory Management:**
   - Unix/Linux: `cp` (copy files), `mv` (move/rename files), `rm` (remove files), `mkdir` (create directory)
   - Windows: `copy` (copy files), `move` (move/rename files), `del` (delete files), `mkdir` (create directory)

3. **System Information and Processes:**
   - Unix/Linux: `top` or `htop` (view running processes), `ps` (list processes), `df` (disk usage), `uname` (system info)
   - Windows: `tasklist` (list processes), `taskkill` (kill process), `systeminfo` (system details)

4. **File Permissions and Ownership:**
   - Unix/Linux: `chmod` (change file permissions), `chown` (change file ownership)
   - Windows: `icacls` (modify access control lists), `attrib` (change file attributes)

5. **Network Commands:**
   - Unix/Linux: `ping` (test network connection), `ifconfig` or `ip` (network interface configuration), `netstat` (network statistics)
   - Windows: `ping` (test network connection), `ipconfig` (network configuration), `netstat` (network statistics)

These commands form the foundation of interacting with and managing an OS via the command line, providing greater control over system operations compared to graphical interfaces.
