# Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration details, such as subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS servers, to devices on a network. When a device, such as a computer or smartphone, connects to a network, it sends a request to the DHCP server, which then dynamically assigns an available IP address from a defined range and provides the necessary configuration information. This process simplifies network management by eliminating the need for manual IP address assignment and reduces the risk of IP conflicts, ensuring that devices can seamlessly join the network and communicate with other devices and services.
