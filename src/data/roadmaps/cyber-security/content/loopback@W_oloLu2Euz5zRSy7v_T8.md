# loopback

**Loopback** refers to a special network interface used to send traffic back to the same device for testing and diagnostic purposes. The loopback address for IPv4 is `127.0.0.1`, while for IPv6 it is `::1`. When a device sends a request to the loopback address, the network data does not leave the local machine; instead, it is processed internally, allowing developers to test applications or network services without requiring external network access. Loopback is commonly used to simulate network traffic, check local services, or debug issues locally.
