# VirusTotal

VirusTotal's main feature is multi-scanning using over 70 antivirus scanners to generate a cumulative report on whether a file is malicious. It also stores file hashes, eliminating the need to rescan previously uploaded files. Researchers can comment in the community, sharing their analysis and insights into malware for others to benefit from. VirusTotal's aggregated data comes from various antivirus engines, website scanners, file and URL analysis tools, and user contributions. These tools serve diverse purposes, including heuristic engines, known-bad signatures, metadata extraction, and identification of malicious signals. Additionally, VirusTotal offers services to search by file hash, IP address, and URL, which are also scanned. For more comprehensive features, VirusTotal provides Premium services such as Intelligence & Hunting.
