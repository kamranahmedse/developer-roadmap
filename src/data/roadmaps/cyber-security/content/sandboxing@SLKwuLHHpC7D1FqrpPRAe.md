# Sandboxing

Sandboxing is a security technique where a program or code is isolated in a controlled environment, or "sandbox," to prevent it from affecting other parts of the system. This isolation allows suspicious or untrusted code, such as software, scripts, or files, to be executed and analyzed safely without risking harm to the host system. Sandboxing is commonly used to detect malware or test potentially harmful applications in cybersecurity.
