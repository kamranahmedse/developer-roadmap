# Sandboxing

Sandboxing is a cybersecurity technique that creates an isolated environment to safely execute and analyze suspicious code, preventing any potential harm to the network or system.

## Benefits of Sandboxing

- Sandboxes can be used not only for testing but also for other purposes like project integration, quality assurance, and even customer demonstrations.

- Enhanced network safety and the ability to safely test, monitor, and analyze potentially harmful code without exposing the network to risks.

- Sandboxing is particularly effective against zero-day threats, which are new and previously unknown threats that standard security measures might miss.
