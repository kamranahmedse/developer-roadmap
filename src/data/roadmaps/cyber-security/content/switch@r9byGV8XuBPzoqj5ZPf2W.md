# Switch

A switch is a network device that operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, connecting multiple devices within a local area network (LAN). It uses MAC addresses to forward data packets between devices, creating separate collision domains for each port. Switches improve network efficiency by sending packets only to their intended destinations, reducing unnecessary traffic. They support full-duplex communication, allowing simultaneous data transmission in both directions. Modern switches often include advanced features like VLANs, port mirroring, and Quality of Service (QoS) management. Switches are fundamental to creating efficient, segmented networks and are crucial components in both small office and large enterprise network infrastructures.
