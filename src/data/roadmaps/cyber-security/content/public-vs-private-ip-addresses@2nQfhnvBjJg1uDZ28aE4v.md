# Public vs Private IP Addresses

Public addresses are IP addresses assigned to devices directly accessible over the internet, allowing them to communicate with external networks and services. In contrast, private addresses are used within local networks and are not routable over the internet, providing a way for devices within a private network to communicate with each other while conserving public IP address space. Public addresses are unique across the internet, whereas private addresses are reused across different local networks and are typically managed by network address translation (NAT) to interface with public networks.
