# Endpoint Security

Endpoint security focuses on protecting individual devices that connect to a network, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, and IoT devices. It's a critical component of modern cybersecurity strategy, as endpoints often serve as entry points for cyberattacks. This approach involves deploying and managing security software on each device, including antivirus programs, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems. Advanced endpoint protection solutions may incorporate machine learning and behavioral analysis to detect and respond to novel threats. Endpoint security also encompasses patch management, device encryption, and access controls to mitigate risks associated with lost or stolen devices. As remote work and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies become more prevalent, endpoint security has evolved to include cloud-based management and zero-trust architectures, ensuring that security extends beyond the traditional network perimeter to protect data and systems regardless of device location or ownership.
