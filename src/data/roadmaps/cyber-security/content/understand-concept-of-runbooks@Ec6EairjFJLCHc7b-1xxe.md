# Understand Concept of Runbooks

Runbooks are standardized documents or automated scripts that outline step-by-step procedures for carrying out specific IT operations or resolving common issues. They provide a consistent approach to routine tasks, incident response, and problem-solving, enabling IT teams to handle situations efficiently and minimize human error. Runbooks typically include detailed instructions, decision trees, troubleshooting guides, and may incorporate automation for repetitive tasks. They are essential for maintaining operational consistency, reducing downtime, facilitating knowledge transfer among team members, and supporting rapid incident resolution in complex IT environments. Modern runbooks are often digital, interactive, and integrated with IT service management tools for streamlined operations and continuous improvement.
