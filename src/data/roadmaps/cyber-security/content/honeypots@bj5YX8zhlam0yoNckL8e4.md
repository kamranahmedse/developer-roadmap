# Honeypots

Honeypots are decoy systems or networks designed to attract and detect unauthorized access attempts by cybercriminals. These intentionally vulnerable resources mimic legitimate targets, allowing security professionals to study attack techniques, gather threat intelligence, and divert attackers from actual critical systems. Honeypots can range from low-interaction systems that simulate basic services to high-interaction ones that replicate entire network environments. They serve multiple purposes in cybersecurity: early warning systems for detecting new attack vectors, research tools for understanding attacker behavior, and diversions to waste hackers' time and resources. However, deploying honeypots requires careful consideration, as they can potentially introduce risks if not properly isolated from production environments. Advanced honeypots may incorporate machine learning to adapt to evolving threats and provide more convincing decoys. While honeypots are powerful tools for proactive defense, they should be part of a comprehensive security strategy rather than a standalone solution.
