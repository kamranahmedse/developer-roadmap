# tail

The tail command is a Unix/Linux utility used to display the last part of a file. By default, it shows the last 10 lines of a specified file. It's particularly useful for viewing recent entries in log files, monitoring file changes in real-time, and quickly checking the end of large text files. The command can be customized to display a different number of lines, and with the -f (follow) option, it can continuously update to show new lines as they're added to the file. This makes tail invaluable for system administrators and developers for real-time log monitoring, troubleshooting, and observing ongoing processes or application outputs.
