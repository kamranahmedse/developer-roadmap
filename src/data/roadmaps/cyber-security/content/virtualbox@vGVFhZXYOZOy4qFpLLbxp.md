VirtualBox is a free, open-source virtualization software developed by Oracle. It allows users to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine. VirtualBox supports a wide range of guest operating systems, including various versions of Windows, Linux, macOS, and more. It provides features like snapshots for easy system state preservation, shared folders for file exchange between host and guest systems, and USB device support. VirtualBox is popular among developers, IT professionals, and enthusiasts for testing software, running legacy applications, and experimenting with different operating systems without the need for separate physical hardware.
