# Domain Name System (DNS)

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a fundamental protocol of the internet that translates human-readable domain names, like `www.example.com`, into IP addresses, such as `192.0.2.1`, which are used by computers to locate and communicate with each other. Essentially, DNS acts as the internet's phonebook, enabling users to access websites and services without needing to memorize numerical IP addresses. When a user types a domain name into a browser, a DNS query is sent to a DNS server, which then resolves the domain into its corresponding IP address, allowing the browser to connect to the appropriate server. DNS is crucial for the functionality of the internet, as it underpins virtually all online activities by ensuring that requests are routed to the correct destinations.
