# Understand Common Hacking Tools

Common hacking tools encompass a range of software used for network exploration, security auditing, and penetration testing. These include network scanners like Nmap, vulnerability assessment tools such as Nessus, password crackers like John the Ripper, and exploitation frameworks like Metasploit. Wireshark for packet analysis, Burp Suite for web application security testing, and Aircrack-ng for wireless network auditing are also widely used. While these tools have legitimate purposes in cybersecurity for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, they can be misused for malicious activities. Ethical use of these tools requires proper authorization and adherence to legal and ethical guidelines. Understanding these tools is crucial for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity practices.
