# RMF

A **Risk Management Framework (RMF)** is a structured approach that organizations use to identify, assess, manage, and mitigate risks. It provides a systematic process to ensure that risks are effectively controlled and aligned with the organization's objectives. Key components include:

1. **Risk Identification:** Identifying potential internal and external risks that could impact the organization.
2. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluating the likelihood and impact of identified risks.
3. **Risk Mitigation:** Developing strategies to reduce or eliminate risks, such as controls, policies, and contingency plans.
4. **Risk Monitoring:** Continuously tracking risks and the effectiveness of mitigation measures.
5. **Communication and Reporting:** Regularly updating stakeholders on the risk status and actions taken.
6. **Review and Improvement:** Periodically reassessing the framework and adapting to changes in the business or regulatory environment.

The RMF ensures that risks are managed proactively and consistently across the organization, helping to safeguard assets and support strategic decision-making.
