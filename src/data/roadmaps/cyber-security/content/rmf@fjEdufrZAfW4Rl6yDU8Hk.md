# RMF

A **Risk Management Framework (RMF)** is a structured approach that organizations use to identify, assess, manage, and mitigate risks. It provides a systematic process to ensure that risks are effectively controlled and aligned with the organization's objectives. Key components include:

1.  **Risk Identification:** Identifying potential internal and external risks that could impact the organization.
2.  **Risk Assessment:** Evaluating the likelihood and impact of identified risks.
3.  **Risk Mitigation:** Developing strategies to reduce or eliminate risks, such as controls, policies, and contingency plans.
4.  **Risk Monitoring:** Continuously tracking risks and the effectiveness of mitigation measures.
5.  **Communication and Reporting:** Regularly updating stakeholders on the risk status and actions taken.
6.  **Review and Improvement:** Periodically reassessing the framework and adapting to changes in the business or regulatory environment.
