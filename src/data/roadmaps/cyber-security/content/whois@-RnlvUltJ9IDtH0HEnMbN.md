# Whois

WHOIS is a query and response protocol used to retrieve information about registered domain names, IP addresses, and autonomous systems on the Internet. It provides details such as the domain registrar, registration date, expiration date, and contact information for the domain owner (although this may be limited due to privacy protection). WHOIS databases are maintained by regional Internet registries and domain registrars. The protocol is commonly used by network administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and researchers for tasks like verifying domain ownership, investigating potential cyber threats, and gathering information for legal or business purposes. However, with the implementation of GDPR and other privacy regulations, some WHOIS information has become more restricted.
