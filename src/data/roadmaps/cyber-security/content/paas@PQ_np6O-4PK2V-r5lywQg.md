# PaaS

Platform as a Service, or **PaaS**, is a type of cloud computing service that provides a platform for developers to create, deploy, and maintain software applications. PaaS combines the software development platform and the underlying infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networking resources. This enables developers to focus on writing and managing their applications, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure's setup, maintenance, and scalability. PaaS simplifies the application development and deployment process by providing a platform and its associated tools, saving developers time and resources. By leveraging PaaS, organizations can focus on their core competencies and build innovative applications without worrying about infrastructure management.
