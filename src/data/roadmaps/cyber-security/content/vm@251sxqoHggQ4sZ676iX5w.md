# VM

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications, isolated from the underlying hardware. VMs allow multiple "guest" operating systems to run on a single physical "host" machine, each with its own allocated virtual resources (CPU, memory, storage). This technology enables efficient hardware utilization, easier system administration, and improved security through isolation. VMs are widely used in cloud computing, software development, testing environments, and for running legacy applications. Hypervisors, such as VMware vSphere or Microsoft Hyper-V, manage the creation and operation of VMs on physical hardware.
