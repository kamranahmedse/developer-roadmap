# syslog

Syslog is a standard protocol used for message logging in computer systems, particularly in Unix-like environments. It allows separation of the software that generates messages, the system that stores them, and the software that reports and analyzes them. Syslog messages typically include information about system events, security incidents, and application statuses, categorized by facility and severity level. These logs are crucial for system administration, troubleshooting, security monitoring, and compliance. Many network devices and applications support syslog, enabling centralized log management. Syslog data can be stored locally or sent to remote servers for aggregation and analysis, playing a vital role in maintaining system health, detecting anomalies, and conducting forensic investigations.
