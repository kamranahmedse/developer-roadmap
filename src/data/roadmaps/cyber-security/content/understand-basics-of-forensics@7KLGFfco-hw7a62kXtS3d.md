# Understand Basics of Forensics

Digital forensics is the process of collecting, analyzing, and preserving electronic evidence for legal or investigative purposes. It involves recovering data from various digital devices, including computers, smartphones, and networks, often in cases of cybercrime, data breaches, or legal disputes. Forensic analysts use specialized tools and techniques to extract and examine data, maintain chain of custody, and present findings in a court-admissible manner. Key aspects include data acquisition, file recovery, timeline analysis, and malware detection. Digital forensics plays a crucial role in cybersecurity incident response, criminal investigations, and corporate compliance, requiring a meticulous approach to ensure the integrity and admissibility of digital evidence.
