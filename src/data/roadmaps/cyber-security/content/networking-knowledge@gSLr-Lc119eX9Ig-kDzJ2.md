# Networking Knowledge

**Networking knowledge** encompasses understanding the principles, technologies, and protocols involved in connecting and managing networks. Key areas include:

- **Network Protocols**: Familiarity with protocols like TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, and HTTP, which govern data transmission and communication between devices.
- **Network Topologies**: Knowledge of network architectures such as star, ring, mesh, and hybrid topologies, which influence how devices are interconnected.
- **IP Addressing and Subnetting**: Understanding IP address allocation, subnetting, and CIDR notation for organizing and managing network addresses.
- **Network Devices**: Knowledge of routers, switches, firewalls, and access points, and their roles in directing traffic, providing security, and enabling connectivity.
- **Network Security**: Awareness of security measures like VPNs, firewalls, IDS/IPS, and encryption to protect data and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Troubleshooting**: Skills in diagnosing and resolving network issues using tools like ping, traceroute, and network analyzers.

This knowledge is essential for designing, implementing, and maintaining effective and secure network infrastructures.
