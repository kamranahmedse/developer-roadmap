# WiFi

WiFi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet and communicate with each other without physical cables. It uses radio waves to transmit data, typically operating on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. WiFi networks are created by wireless routers or access points and can be found in homes, offices, public spaces, and many other locations. The technology follows IEEE 802.11 standards, with newer versions (like WiFi 6 or 802.11ax) offering increased speeds, better performance in crowded areas, and improved energy efficiency. WiFi enables the proliferation of mobile and smart devices, supporting the Internet of Things (IoT) and allowing for greater flexibility and mobility in network connectivity.
