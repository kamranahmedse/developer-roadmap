# VPN

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a secure connection method used to extend private networks across public networks like the Internet. It creates an encrypted tunnel between the user's device and a remote server, masking the user's IP address and encrypting data in transit. VPNs are used for various purposes, including enhancing online privacy, bypassing geographical restrictions, securing communications over public Wi-Fi, and allowing remote access to corporate networks. They employ protocols like OpenVPN, L2TP/IPsec, or WireGuard to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. While VPNs offer significant privacy and security benefits, their effectiveness can vary based on the provider's policies and the specific implementation.
