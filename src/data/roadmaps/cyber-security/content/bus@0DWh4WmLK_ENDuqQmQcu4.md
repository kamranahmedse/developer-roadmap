# Bus

In the context of cybersecurity, a bus refers to a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer or between computers. It's a critical part of computer architecture that can be vulnerable to various security threats. Attackers may attempt to exploit bus systems to intercept sensitive data, inject malicious code, or perform side-channel attacks. These vulnerabilities can exist at different levels, from the system bus connecting major computer components to expansion buses for peripheral devices. Securing bus communications involves implementing encryption, access controls, and monitoring for unusual activity. As buses play a crucial role in data transfer, protecting them is essential for maintaining the overall security and integrity of computer systems and networks.
