# PKI

**Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** is a framework that manages digital certificates and public-private key pairs, enabling secure communication, authentication, and data encryption over networks. PKI supports various security services such as confidentiality, integrity, and digital signatures. It includes components like **Certificate Authorities (CAs)**, which issue and revoke digital certificates, **Registration Authorities (RAs)**, which verify the identity of certificate requestors, and **certificates** themselves, which bind public keys to individuals or entities. PKI is essential for secure online transactions, encrypted communications, and identity verification in applications like SSL/TLS, email encryption, and code signing.
