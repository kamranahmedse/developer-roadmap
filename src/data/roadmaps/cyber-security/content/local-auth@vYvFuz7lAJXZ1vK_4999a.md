# Local Auth

Local authentication refers to the process of verifying a user's identity on a specific device or system without relying on external servers or networks. It typically involves storing and checking credentials directly on the device itself. Common methods include username/password combinations, biometrics (fingerprint, face recognition), or PIN codes. Local authentication is often used for device access, offline applications, or as a fallback when network-based authentication is unavailable. While it offers quick access and works without internet connectivity, it can be less secure than centralized authentication systems and more challenging to manage across multiple devices. Local authentication is commonly used in personal devices, standalone systems, and scenarios where network-based authentication is impractical or unnecessary.
