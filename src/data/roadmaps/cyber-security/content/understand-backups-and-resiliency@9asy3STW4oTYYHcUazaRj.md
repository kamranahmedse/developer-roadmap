# Understand Backups and Resiliency

Backups and resiliency are critical components of data protection and business continuity strategies. Backups involve regularly copying data to secure storage locations, ensuring data can be recovered in case of loss, corruption, or disaster. Resiliency refers to a system's ability to maintain operations and recover quickly from disruptions. This includes implementing redundant systems, distributing resources across multiple locations, and designing fault-tolerant architectures. Effective backup and resiliency strategies incorporate diverse backup methods (full, incremental, differential), off-site storage, regular testing of recovery procedures, and automated failover mechanisms. These practices are essential for minimizing downtime, protecting against data loss, and maintaining business operations in the face of various threats, from hardware failures to cyberattacks.
