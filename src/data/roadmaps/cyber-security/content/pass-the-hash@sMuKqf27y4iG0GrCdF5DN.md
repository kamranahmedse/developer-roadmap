# Pass the Hash

Pass the Hash (PtH) is a hacking technique that allows an attacker to authenticate to a remote server or service using the hashed value of a user's password, without needing to know the actual plaintext password. This method exploits weaknesses in the way some authentication protocols handle hashed credentials, particularly in Windows-based systems.
