# Understand concepts of security in the cloud

Cloud security encompasses the measures, controls, policies, and technologies implemented to protect data, applications, and infrastructure associated with cloud computing environments. It involves securing data both in transit and at rest, managing access controls, ensuring compliance with regulations, and protecting against threats like data breaches, account hijacking, and DDoS attacks. Cloud security strategies often include encryption, multi-factor authentication, regular security audits, and shared responsibility models between cloud providers and customers. While cloud platforms offer advanced security features, organizations must also adapt their security practices to address the unique challenges of cloud environments, such as data sovereignty issues, shared infrastructure risks, and the need for continuous monitoring across distributed systems.
