# What is Evil Twin attack

An Evil Twin is a type of wireless network attack where an attacker sets up a rogue Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate Wi-Fi network. The rogue access point has the same SSID (network name) as the legitimate network, making it difficult for users to distinguish between the two. The attacker's goal is to trick users into connecting to the rogue access point, allowing them to intercept sensitive information, inject malware, or launch other types of attacks.
