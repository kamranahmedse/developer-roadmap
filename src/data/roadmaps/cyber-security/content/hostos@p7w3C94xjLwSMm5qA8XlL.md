# Host OS

A Host Operating System (Host OS) refers to the primary operating system installed directly on a computer's hardware, managing the physical resources and providing a platform for running applications and, in virtualized environments, supporting virtual machines. In cybersecurity, the Host OS plays a critical role as it forms the foundation of the system's security posture. It's responsible for implementing core security features such as access controls, system hardening, and patch management. The Host OS often runs the hypervisor software in virtualized environments, making its security crucial for protecting all guest operating systems and applications running on top of it. Vulnerabilities in the Host OS can potentially compromise all hosted virtual machines and services. Therefore, securing the Host OS through regular updates, proper configuration, and robust monitoring is essential for maintaining the overall security of both physical and virtualized IT infrastructures.
