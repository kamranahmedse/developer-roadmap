# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a security solution designed to monitor and analyze network traffic for signs of suspicious activity or potential threats. NIDS operates by inspecting the data packets that flow through a network, looking for patterns that match known attack signatures or anomalies that could indicate malicious behavior. Unlike a Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS), which focuses on individual host devices, NIDS provides a broader view by monitoring network traffic across multiple systems and devices.
