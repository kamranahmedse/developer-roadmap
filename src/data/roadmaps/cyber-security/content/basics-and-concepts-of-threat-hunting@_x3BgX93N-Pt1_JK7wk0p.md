# Basics and Concepts of Threat Hunting

Threat hunting is a proactive approach to cybersecurity where security professionals actively search for hidden threats or adversaries that may have bypassed traditional security measures, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Rather than waiting for automated tools to flag suspicious activity, threat hunters use a combination of human intuition, threat intelligence, and advanced analysis techniques to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs) and potential threats within a network or system. The process involves several key concepts, starting with a **hypothesis**, where a hunter develops a theory about potential vulnerabilities or attack vectors that could be exploited. They then conduct a **search** through logs, traffic data, or endpoint activity to look for anomalies or patterns that may indicate malicious behavior. **Data analysis** is central to threat hunting, as hunters analyze vast amounts of network and system data to uncover subtle signs of attacks or compromises. If threats are found, the findings lead to **detection and mitigation**, allowing the security team to contain the threat, remove malicious entities, and prevent similar incidents in the future.
