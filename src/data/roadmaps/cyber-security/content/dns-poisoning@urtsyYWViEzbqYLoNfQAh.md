DNS spoofing or DNS cache poisoning, occurs when fake information is inserted into a DNS serverâ€™s cache.This causes DNS queries to return incorrect IP addresses, directing users to the wrong websites. Hackers exploit this to reroute traffic to malicious sites. The issue persists until the cached information is corrected.When the cache is poisoned, it misdirects traffic until the incorrect information is fixed. This technique exploits vulnerabilities in the DNS system and can spread to other servers, causing widespread issues.
