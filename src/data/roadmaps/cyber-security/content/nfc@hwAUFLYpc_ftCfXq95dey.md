# NFC

**Near Field Communication (NFC)** is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to communicate and exchange data over very short distances, typically up to 4 inches (10 cm). NFC is commonly used for applications such as contactless payments, electronic ticketing, and data transfer between devices. It operates at a frequency of 13.56 MHz and supports various modes, including peer-to-peer communication, card emulation, and reader/writer modes. NFC enables quick and secure interactions with minimal setup, making it convenient for mobile payments, access control, and sharing information.
