# Shoulder Surfing

In a Shoulder Surfing Attack, an attacker tries to get information when you are unaware of where the attacker looks over your shoulder or from your back to see what you're doing on your device and obtain sensitive information. Shoulder Surfing attacks are accomplished by observing the content "over the victim's shoulder". It is a social engineering attack where the attackers physically view the device screen and keypad to obtain personal information. This attack is mostly done when you are in a public place or crowded area. Sometimes attackers attack when you are busy on your device and the attacker could be your friend, someone you know or it may be some stranger.
