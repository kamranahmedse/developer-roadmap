# IPAM

IP Address Management (IPAM) is a critical aspect of cyber security, as it helps organizations efficiently manage and track their IP addresses, DNS, and DHCP services. In any network, devices like servers, routers, and switches are assigned unique IP addresses, which enables them to communicate with each other. Efficient and secure management of these IP addresses is vital for maintaining network security and prevent unauthorized access.
