# Host-based Firewall

A host-based firewall is a software application that runs directly on individual devices, such as computers, servers, or mobile devices, to control network traffic to and from that specific host. It acts as a security barrier, monitoring and filtering incoming and outgoing network connections based on predefined rules. Host-based firewalls provide an additional layer of protection beyond network firewalls, allowing for more granular control over each device's network activities. They can block unauthorized access attempts, prevent malware from communicating with command and control servers, and restrict applications from making unexpected network connections. This approach is particularly valuable in environments with mobile or remote workers, where devices may not always be protected by corporate network firewalls. However, managing host-based firewalls across numerous devices can be challenging, requiring careful policy configuration and regular updates to maintain effective security without impeding legitimate user activities.
