# Hypervisor

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is software or firmware that enables the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) by abstracting the underlying hardware. It allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine, each operating independently with its own operating system and applications. Hypervisors facilitate better resource utilization by allowing a physical server to host several virtual environments, optimizing hardware efficiency.
