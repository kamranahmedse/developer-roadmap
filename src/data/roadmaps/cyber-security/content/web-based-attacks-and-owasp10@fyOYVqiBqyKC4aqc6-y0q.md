# Web Based Attacks and OWASP 10

The OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top 10 is a regularly updated list of the most critical web application security risks. It serves as a standard awareness document for developers and security professionals, highlighting the most important security concerns in web applications. The list includes vulnerabilities like injection flaws, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, XML external entities (XXE), broken access control, security misconfigurations, cross-site scripting (XSS), insecure deserialization, using components with known vulnerabilities, and insufficient logging and monitoring. This resource helps organizations prioritize security efforts, guide secure development practices, and improve overall web application security posture.
