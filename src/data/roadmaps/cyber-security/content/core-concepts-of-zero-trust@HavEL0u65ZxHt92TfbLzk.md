# Core Concepts of Zero Trust

The core concepts of Zero Trust revolve around the principle of "never trust, always verify," emphasizing the need to continuously validate every user, device, and application attempting to access resources, regardless of their location within or outside the network perimeter. Unlike traditional security models that rely on a strong perimeter defense, Zero Trust assumes that threats could already exist inside the network and that no entity should be trusted by default. Key principles include strict identity verification, least privilege access, micro-segmentation, and continuous monitoring. This approach limits access to resources based on user roles, enforces granular security policies, and continuously monitors for abnormal behavior, ensuring that security is maintained even if one segment of the network is compromised. Zero Trust is designed to protect modern IT environments from evolving threats by focusing on securing data and resources, rather than just the network perimeter.
