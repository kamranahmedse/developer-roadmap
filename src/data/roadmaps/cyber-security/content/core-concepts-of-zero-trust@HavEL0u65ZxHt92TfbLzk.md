# Core Concepts of Zero Trust

_Zero Trust_ is a modern security framework that addresses the ever-evolving threat landscape in the digital world. It emphasizes the idea of "never trust, always verify". This approach requires organizations to abandon the traditional perimeter-based security models and adopt a more comprehensive, holistic approach to protecting their data and assets.

## Core Principles

- **Deny trust by default**: Assume all network traffic, both inside and outside the organization, is potentially malicious. Do not trust any user, device, or application just because they are within the network perimeter.

- **Verify every request**: Authenticate and authorize all requests (even for those from within the network) before granting access to any resource. Ensure that each user, device, or application is properly identified, and their access to resources is appropriate based on their role, rights, and privileges.

- **Apply least privilege**: Limit users, applications, and devices to the minimum level of access required to perform their functions. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, and reduces the potential attack surface.

- **Segment networks**: Isolate and segregate different parts of the network to limit the potential impact of a breach. If an attacker gains access to one segment, they should not be able to move laterally across the network and access other sensitive data.

- **Inspect and log all traffic**: Actively monitor, analyze, and log network traffic to identify potential security incidents and perform forensic investigations. This provides valuable insights for security teams to continuously improve their security posture and detect early signs of malicious activities.

## Benefits

- **Reduced attack surface**: Limiting access to sensitive resources and segmenting the network makes it more challenging for attackers to compromise systems and access valuable data.

- **Enhanced visibility and monitoring**: By continuously inspecting and logging all traffic, security teams can gain unprecedented levels of visibility, helping them identify potential threats and attacks more effectively.

- **Improved compliance and governance**: Implementing a Zero Trust model reinforces an organization's compliance and governance posture, ensuring access to sensitive data is only granted to authorized users.

- **Adaptability**: A Zero Trust approach can be applied to a wide range of environments and can be tailored to meet the specific security needs and objectives of an organization.

By implementing a Zero Trust framework, an organization can strengthen its security posture, safeguard against internal and external threats, and maintain control over their critical assets in an increasingly interconnected world.
