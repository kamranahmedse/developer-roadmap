# GTFOBINS

GTFOBins (GTFOBINS) is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be exploited by attackers to bypass local security restrictions on a misconfigured system. It provides a detailed index of commands and scripts, demonstrating how certain binaries, when used improperly, can enable privilege escalation, file manipulation, and other unauthorized activities, thus serving as a resource for both security professionals to understand potential vulnerabilities and for attackers to identify and exploit weaknesses.
