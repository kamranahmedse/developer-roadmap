# EDR

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a cybersecurity technology that provides continuous monitoring and response to threats at the endpoint level. It is designed to detect, investigate, and mitigate suspicious activities on endpoints such as laptops, desktops, and mobile devices. EDR solutions log and analyze behaviors on these devices to identify potential threats, such as malware or ransomware, that have bypassed traditional security measures like antivirus software. This technology equips security teams with the tools to quickly respond to and contain threats, minimizing the risk of a security breach spreading across the network. EDR systems are an essential component of modern cybersecurity strategies, offering advanced protection by utilizing real-time analytics, AI-driven automation, and comprehensive data recording.
