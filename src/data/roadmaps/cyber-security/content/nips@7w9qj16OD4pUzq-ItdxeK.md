# NIPS

A **Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)** is a security technology designed to monitor, detect, and prevent malicious activities or policy violations on a network. Unlike intrusion detection systems (IDS), which only alert on potential threats, a NIPS actively blocks or mitigates suspicious traffic in real-time. It analyzes network traffic patterns, inspects packet contents, and uses predefined signatures or behavioral analysis to identify threats. By preventing attacks such as malware, unauthorized access, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, a NIPS helps protect network integrity and maintain secure operations.
