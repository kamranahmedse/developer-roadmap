# C++

C++ is a widely-used, high-level programming language that evolved from the earlier C programming language. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985 at Bell Labs, C++ provides object-oriented features and low-level memory manipulation, making it an essential language for many fields, including game development, high-performance systems, and cybersecurity.
