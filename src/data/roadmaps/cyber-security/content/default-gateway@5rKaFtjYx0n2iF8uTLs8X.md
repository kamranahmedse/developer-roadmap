# default gateway

A default gateway is a network node, typically a router or a firewall, that serves as the access point or intermediary between a local network and external networks, such as the internet. When a device on a local network needs to communicate with a device outside its own subnet—such as accessing a website or sending an email—it sends the data to the default gateway, which then routes it to the appropriate external destination. The default gateway acts as a traffic director, ensuring that data packets are correctly forwarded between the internal network and external networks, making it a crucial component for enabling communication beyond the local network's boundaries.
