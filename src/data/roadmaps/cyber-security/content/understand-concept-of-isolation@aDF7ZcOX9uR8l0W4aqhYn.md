# Understand the Concept of Isolation

Isolation in computing and cybersecurity refers to the practice of separating systems, processes, or data to contain potential threats and minimize the impact of security breaches. It involves creating boundaries between different components of a system or network to prevent unauthorized access or the spread of malware. Common isolation techniques include virtual machines, containers, network segmentation, and sandboxing. Isolation enhances security by limiting the attack surface, containing potential breaches, and protecting sensitive data or critical systems from compromised areas. It's a fundamental principle in designing secure architectures, implementing least privilege access, and managing multi-tenant environments in cloud computing.
