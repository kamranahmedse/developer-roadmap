# Diamond Model

The Diamond Model is a cybersecurity framework used for analyzing and understanding cyber threats by breaking down an attack into four core components: Adversary, Infrastructure, Capability, and Victim. The Adversary represents the entity behind the attack, the Infrastructure refers to the systems and resources used by the attacker (such as command and control servers), the Capability denotes the tools or malware employed, and the Victim is the target of the attack. The model emphasizes the relationships between these components, helping analysts to identify patterns, track adversary behavior, and understand the broader context of cyber threats. By visualizing and connecting these elements, the Diamond Model aids in developing more effective detection, mitigation, and response strategies.
