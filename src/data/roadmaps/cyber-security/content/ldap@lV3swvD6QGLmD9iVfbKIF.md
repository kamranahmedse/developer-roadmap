# LDAP

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a standardized application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an IP network. It's primarily used for querying and modifying directory services, such as user authentication and information lookup. LDAP organizes data in a hierarchical tree structure and is commonly used in enterprise environments for centralized user management, authentication, and authorization. It supports features like single sign-on and can integrate with various applications and services. LDAP is widely used in conjunction with Active Directory and other directory services to provide a centralized repository for user accounts, groups, and other organizational data, facilitating efficient user and resource management in networked environments.
