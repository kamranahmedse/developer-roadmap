# Cyber Kill Chain

The **Cyber Kill Chain** is a model that was developed by Lockheed Martin, a major aerospace, military support, and security company, to understand and prevent cyber intrusions in various networks and systems. It serves as a framework for breaking down the stages of a cyber attack, making it easier for security professionals to identify, mitigate, and prevent threats.

The concept is based on a military model, where the term "kill chain" represents a series of steps needed to successfully target and engage an adversary. In the context of cybersecurity, the model breaks down the stages of a cyber attack into seven distinct phases:

*   **Reconnaissance**: This initial phase involves gathering intelligence on the target, which may include researching public databases, performing network scans, or social engineering techniques.
*   **Weaponization**: In this stage, the attacker creates a weapon – such as a malware, virus, or exploit – and packages it with a delivery mechanism that can infiltrate the target's system.
*   **Delivery**: The attacker selects and deploys the delivery method to transmit the weapon to the target. Common methods include email attachments, malicious URLs, or infected software updates.
*   **Exploitation**: This is the phase where the weapon is activated, taking advantage of vulnerabilities in the target's systems or applications to execute the attacker's code.
*   **Installation**: Once the exploit is successful, the attacker installs the malware on the victim's system, setting the stage for further attacks or data exfiltration.
*   **Command and Control (C2)**: The attacker establishes a communication channel with the infected system, allowing them to remotely control the malware and conduct further actions.
*   **Actions on Objectives**: In this final phase, the attacker achieves their goal, which may involve stealing sensitive data, compromising systems, or disrupting services.
