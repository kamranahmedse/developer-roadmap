# Smishing

Smishing, a portmanteau of "SMS" and "phishing," is a form of cyber attack that uses text messages (SMS) to deceive recipients into divulging sensitive information or taking harmful actions. Attackers typically impersonate trusted entities like banks, government agencies, or popular services, urging victims to click on malicious links, download harmful apps, or provide personal data. These messages often create a sense of urgency or offer enticing rewards to manipulate recipients. Smishing exploits the trust people place in mobile communications and the limited security features of SMS. As mobile device usage increases, smishing has become a significant threat, requiring user awareness and caution when interacting with unsolicited text messages.
