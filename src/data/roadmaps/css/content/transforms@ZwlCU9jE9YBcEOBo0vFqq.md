# Transforms

Transforms in CSS allow you to alter the shape and position of elements in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. This includes operations like rotating, scaling, skewing, and translating elements, providing a way to create visually engaging effects and manipulate the layout without affecting the underlying document flow.
