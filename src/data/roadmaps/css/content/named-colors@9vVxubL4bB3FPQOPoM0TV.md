# Named Colors

Named colors in CSS are predefined color values represented by specific keywords. Instead of using hexadecimal codes or RGB values, you can use names like "red," "blue," "green," or "black" to style elements. These names are understood by browsers and directly translate to specific color values, offering a simple and readable way to apply basic colors to your web pages.
