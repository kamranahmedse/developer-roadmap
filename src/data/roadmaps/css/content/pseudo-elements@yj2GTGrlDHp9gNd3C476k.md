# Pseudo-Elements

Pseudo-elements in CSS let you style specific parts of an element. They allow you to add styles to elements that don't actually exist in the HTML structure, like the first line of a paragraph or content before or after an element. This is done using double colons (::) followed by the pseudo-element name.
