# Inline Display

The `display: inline` property in CSS is used to specify that an element should be displayed as an inline element. Inline elements flow along with the surrounding content, similar to how text flows within a paragraph. They only take up as much width as necessary to contain their content, and the width and height properties do not affect them.
