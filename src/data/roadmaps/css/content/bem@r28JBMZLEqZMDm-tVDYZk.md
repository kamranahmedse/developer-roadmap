# BEM

BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a CSS naming convention that helps developers create more modular, reusable, and maintainable code. It structures class names to reflect the relationships between different parts of a user interface. This approach makes it easier to understand the purpose of each CSS rule and how it relates to the HTML structure, leading to more organized and scalable stylesheets.
