# Position

Position in CSS controls how an element is placed within its containing element or the document itself. It allows you to precisely define where an element appears on the page, influencing its relationship with other elements and the overall layout. Different position values offer varying levels of control, from static placement within the normal document flow to fixed positions that remain in place even when the user scrolls.
