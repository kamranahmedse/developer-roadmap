# Visibility

The `visibility` property in CSS controls whether an element is visible or hidden. When an element's visibility is set to `hidden`, it disappears from the page, but the space it would have occupied remains. This is different from `display: none`, which removes the element from the document flow entirely, causing surrounding elements to reflow.
