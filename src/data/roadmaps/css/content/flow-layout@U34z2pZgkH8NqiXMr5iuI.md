# Flow Layout

Flow layout is the default way elements are positioned on a webpage. Elements are displayed one after another, like words in a sentence, following the natural flow of the HTML. Block-level elements take up the full width available and start on a new line, while inline elements flow within the content, only taking up the space they need.
