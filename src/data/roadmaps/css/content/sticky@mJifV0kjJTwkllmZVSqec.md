# Sticky Positioning

Sticky positioning in CSS is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. An element with `position: sticky;` is initially positioned relatively, but when the user scrolls to a point where the element would normally scroll off-screen, it becomes fixed, sticking to the specified offset (e.g., `top: 0;`) until the containing block's boundary is reached.
