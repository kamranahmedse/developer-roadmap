# CSS Functions

CSS functions are pre-defined operations that perform specific tasks within your CSS code. They allow you to manipulate values, perform calculations, and generate dynamic results, making your stylesheets more flexible and powerful. These functions are used within CSS property values to modify or create those values based on certain inputs.
