# Font Families

Font families in CSS are a way to specify the typeface used to display text on a webpage. They allow you to define a prioritized list of fonts, so if the user's computer doesn't have the first font available, the browser will try the next one in the list, and so on. This ensures that text is always displayed in a readable font, even if the preferred font isn't available.
