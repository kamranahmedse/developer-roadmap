# Container Queries

Container Queries are a CSS feature that allows styles to be applied to an element based on the size or other characteristics of its containing element, rather than the viewport. This enables more granular and context-aware styling, where components can adapt their appearance based on the space available within their parent container, leading to more flexible and reusable designs.
