# CSS Modules

CSS Modules are a system where CSS class names and animation names are scoped locally by default. This means that the class names you define in your CSS files are automatically transformed to be unique, preventing naming collisions and making it easier to manage styles in large projects. They offer a way to write modular and reusable CSS, ensuring that styles are applied only to the intended components.
