# Element Selectors

Element selectors in CSS target HTML elements directly by their tag name. They allow you to apply styles to all occurrences of a specific element, such as all `<p>` (paragraph) or `<h1>` (heading) tags on a webpage. This is the most basic type of selector and provides a straightforward way to style common HTML elements.
