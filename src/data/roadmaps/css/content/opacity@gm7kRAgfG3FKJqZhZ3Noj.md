# Opacity

Opacity in CSS controls the transparency of an element. It determines how much of the background behind the element is visible. A value of `1` means the element is fully opaque (not transparent), while a value of `0` means it is completely transparent (invisible). Values between `0` and `1` create varying degrees of transparency.
