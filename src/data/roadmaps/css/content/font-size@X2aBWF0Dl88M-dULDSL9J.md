# Font Size

Font size in CSS determines the size of the text on a webpage. It's a fundamental property that controls the visual prominence and readability of text elements. You can specify font sizes using various units like pixels (px), ems (em), rems (rem), percentages (%), and viewport units (vw, vh). Choosing the right font size is crucial for creating a visually appealing and accessible design.
