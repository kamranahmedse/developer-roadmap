# Next Sibling Combinator

The next-sibling combinator in CSS (represented by the `+` symbol) selects an element that immediately follows another specific element in the HTML structure. It targets the element that is the very next sibling, meaning it shares the same parent and appears directly after the first element in the source code. This allows you to style elements based on their immediate preceding sibling.
