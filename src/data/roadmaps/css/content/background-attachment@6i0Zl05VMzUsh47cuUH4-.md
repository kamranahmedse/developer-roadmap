# Background Attachment

Background attachment in CSS controls how a background image behaves when the page is scrolled. It determines whether the background image scrolls along with the content or remains fixed in place. This property is useful for creating visual effects like parallax scrolling or keeping a watermark visible regardless of the user's scroll position.
