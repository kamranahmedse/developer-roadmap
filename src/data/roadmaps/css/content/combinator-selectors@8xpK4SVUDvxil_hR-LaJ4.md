# Combinator Selectors

Combinator selectors in CSS define the relationship between elements based on their position in the document's structure. They allow you to target elements that are descendants, children, adjacent siblings, or general siblings of another element. This provides a powerful way to apply styles based on the HTML hierarchy, going beyond simple class or ID targeting.
