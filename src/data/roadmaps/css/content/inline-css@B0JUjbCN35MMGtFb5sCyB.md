# Inline CSS

Inline CSS involves directly embedding CSS styles within HTML elements using the `style` attribute. This method applies styles to individual elements, overriding external stylesheets or embedded styles. While offering quick and localized styling, it's generally discouraged for larger projects due to maintainability issues and separation of concerns.
