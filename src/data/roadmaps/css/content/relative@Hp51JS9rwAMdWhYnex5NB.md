# Relative Positioning

Relative positioning in CSS allows you to shift an element from its normal position in the document flow.  Instead of being fixed in place, the element is moved relative to where it *would* have been if it were statically positioned. This movement doesn't affect the positioning of other elements around it; they behave as if the element were still in its original location. You specify the amount of movement using the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties.
