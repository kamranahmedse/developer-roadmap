# CSS Variables

CSS Variables, also known as custom properties, are entities defined by CSS authors that contain specific values to be reused throughout a stylesheet. They allow you to store a value in one place and then reference it in multiple other places, making it easier to maintain and update your CSS code. This promotes consistency and reduces repetition, leading to more efficient and manageable stylesheets.
