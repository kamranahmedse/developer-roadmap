# Absolute Positioning

Absolute positioning in CSS allows you to precisely place an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position value other than `static`). If no such ancestor exists, the element is positioned relative to the initial containing block, which is typically the `<html>` element. Elements with `position: absolute` are removed from the normal document flow, meaning they don't affect the positioning of other elements around them.
