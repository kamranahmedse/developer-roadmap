# Background Gradient

Background gradients in CSS allow you to create smooth transitions between two or more colors for the background of an element. Instead of a solid color, you can define a gradient that blends colors together, adding visual depth and interest to your designs. These gradients can be linear (flowing in a straight line), radial (emanating from a center point), or conic (rotating around a center point).
