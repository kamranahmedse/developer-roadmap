# Font Shorthand

The font shorthand property in CSS provides a way to set multiple font-related properties in a single declaration. Instead of specifying `font-style`, `font-variant`, `font-weight`, `font-size`, `line-height`, and `font-family` individually, you can use the `font` property to define them all at once, making your stylesheets more concise and readable.
