# Flexbox

Flexbox is a CSS layout model that provides an efficient way to arrange, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. It simplifies the creation of complex layouts by offering powerful tools for controlling the direction, order, size, and alignment of elements within a container. Flexbox is particularly useful for designing responsive and adaptable user interfaces.
