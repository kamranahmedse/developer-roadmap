# Font Variant

Font variant in CSS allows you to control the display of different variations of a font, such as small caps, oldstyle numerals, and alternate glyphs. It provides a way to access OpenType features within a font, enabling richer typographic control beyond basic font styling like size and weight. This property offers a shorthand for setting several more specific font variant properties.
