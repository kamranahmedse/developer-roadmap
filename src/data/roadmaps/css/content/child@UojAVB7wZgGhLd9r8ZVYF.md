# Child Combinator

The child combinator selector in CSS allows you to target elements that are direct children of a specified parent element. It uses the `>` symbol to denote this direct parent-child relationship. This selector ensures that styles are only applied to elements that are immediately nested within the parent, ignoring any deeper descendants.
