# Box Shadows

Box shadows in CSS are visual effects that add depth and dimension to elements by creating a shadow around their frames. These shadows can be customized in terms of color, offset (horizontal and vertical distance), blur radius, and spread radius, allowing designers to simulate various lighting conditions and create visually appealing interfaces. Box shadows can be applied to almost any HTML element, enhancing the user experience by highlighting important elements or adding a subtle sense of realism.
