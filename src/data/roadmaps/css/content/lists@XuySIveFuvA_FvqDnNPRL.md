# Lists

Lists in CSS are used to style HTML list elements, such as `<ul>` (unordered list), `<ol>` (ordered list), and `<dl>` (definition list). CSS provides properties to control the appearance of list markers (bullets or numbers), their position, and the overall styling of the list items. This allows you to customize the visual presentation of lists beyond the default browser styles.
