# HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a website, using elements to define headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other components that are displayed in a web browser. HTML forms the foundation upon which CSS and JavaScript build to create visually appealing and interactive web experiences.
