# Transitions

Transitions in CSS allow you to smoothly change property values over a specified duration. Instead of an abrupt change, a transition creates a gradual effect when a CSS property changes, such as when hovering over an element or when a class is added or removed. This adds visual polish and improves the user experience by making interactions feel more fluid and responsive.
