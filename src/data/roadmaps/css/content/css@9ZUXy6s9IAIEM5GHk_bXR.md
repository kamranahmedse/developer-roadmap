# CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of web pages, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user experience across different devices and screen sizes. Essentially, CSS separates the content of a webpage from its design, making websites easier to maintain and update.
