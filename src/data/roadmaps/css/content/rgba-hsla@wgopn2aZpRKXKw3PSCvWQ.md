# rgba and hsla Colors

`rgba` and `hsla` are color models used in CSS to define colors with added transparency. `rgba` represents colors using Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha (transparency) values, while `hsla` uses Hue, Saturation, Lightness, and Alpha values. The alpha value ranges from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque), allowing for semi-transparent colors.
