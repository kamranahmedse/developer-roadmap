# External CSS

External CSS involves writing CSS rules in a separate file (with a `.css` extension) and then linking that file to your HTML document. This approach promotes cleaner code, easier maintenance, and reusability of styles across multiple web pages. By separating the styling from the content, you can modify the look and feel of your website without altering the HTML structure.
