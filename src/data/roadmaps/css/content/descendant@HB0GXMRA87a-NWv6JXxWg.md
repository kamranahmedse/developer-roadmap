# Descendant Combinator

The descendant combinator in CSS is a way to select HTML elements that are descendants of another element. It uses a single space (" ") between two selectors. The selector on the right side of the space will select all elements that are descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of the element specified by the selector on the left side.
