# CSS Rules

CSS rules are the fundamental building blocks of CSS stylesheets. Each rule specifies how particular HTML elements should be styled. A rule consists of a selector, which identifies the element(s) to be styled, and a declaration block, which contains one or more property-value pairs that define the styles to be applied. These property-value pairs are separated by semicolons and define the visual presentation of the selected elements.
