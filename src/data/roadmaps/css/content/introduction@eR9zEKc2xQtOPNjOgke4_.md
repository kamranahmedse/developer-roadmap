# CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows you to separate the content of your website (HTML) from its visual design, making websites more maintainable and adaptable. CSS uses rules to define how elements should be displayed, targeting specific HTML elements or groups of elements.
