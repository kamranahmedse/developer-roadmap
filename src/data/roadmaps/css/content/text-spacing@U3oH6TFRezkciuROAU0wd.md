# Text Spacing

Text spacing in CSS involves adjusting the space between characters, words, and lines of text. This control allows for improved readability and visual appeal by fine-tuning the horizontal and vertical spacing within text elements. Properties like `letter-spacing`, `word-spacing`, and `line-height` are used to manipulate these spaces.
