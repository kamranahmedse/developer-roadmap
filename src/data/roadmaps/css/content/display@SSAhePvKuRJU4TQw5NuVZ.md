# Display

The `display` property in CSS controls how an element is rendered on a webpage, specifically defining its box type and how it interacts with other elements. It determines whether an element is treated as a block-level element (taking up the full width available), an inline element (flowing within the text), or something else entirely, like a table or a grid container. This property is fundamental for controlling the layout and structure of web pages.
