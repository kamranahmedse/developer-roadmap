# Hex Colors

Hex colors in CSS are a way to specify colors using hexadecimal values. They use a six-digit code, prefixed with a hash symbol (#), to represent the red, green, and blue components of a color. Each pair of digits represents the intensity of one of these primary colors, ranging from 00 (lowest intensity) to FF (highest intensity). For example, #FF0000 is red, #00FF00 is green, and #0000FF is blue.
