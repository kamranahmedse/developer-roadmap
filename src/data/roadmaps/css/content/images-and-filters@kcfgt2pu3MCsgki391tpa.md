# Images and Filters

CSS allows you to incorporate images into your web designs and manipulate their appearance. You can use CSS to control image size, positioning, and how they interact with surrounding content. Additionally, CSS filters enable the direct application of visual effects, such as blurring, color adjustments, and transformations, to images, thereby enhancing their aesthetic appeal without requiring external image editing software.
