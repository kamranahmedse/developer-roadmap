# Multicolumn Layout

Multicolumn layout in CSS allows you to divide a block of content into multiple columns, similar to newspaper layouts. This feature enables text and other content to flow automatically from one column to the next, improving readability and making efficient use of screen space, especially for longer articles or lists. You can control the number of columns, the gap between them, and a rule (line) between the columns for visual separation.
