# Universal Selector

The universal selector in CSS is a simple selector that matches any element on a webpage. Represented by an asterisk (*), it applies a specific style to all elements, regardless of their type or position in the document tree. It's often used to reset or normalize styles across different browsers, ensuring a consistent baseline appearance.
