# Pseudo-Classes

Pseudo-classes in CSS are keywords added to selectors that specify a special state of the selected element(s). They let you style an element based on things like user interaction (e.g., hovering), its position in the document structure (e.g., the first child), or other element characteristics (e.g., being checked). They allow you to apply styles to elements dynamically without needing to modify the HTML or use JavaScript.
