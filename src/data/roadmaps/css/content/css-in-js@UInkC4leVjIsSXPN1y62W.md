# CSS-in-JS

CSS-in-JS is a technique where CSS styles are written with JavaScript instead of external CSS files. This approach allows you to use JavaScript's capabilities, like variables, logic, and component-based architecture, to manage and apply styles directly within your JavaScript code. It offers benefits such as scoped styling, dynamic styling based on component state, and easier management of complex CSS projects.
