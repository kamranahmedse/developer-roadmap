# Subsequent Sibling Combinator

The subsequent-sibling combinator in CSS is a way to select elements that are siblings (elements sharing the same parent) and appear directly after a specified element. It uses the tilde (~) symbol to denote this relationship. This selector targets all following siblings, not just the immediately adjacent one.
