# Text Shadows

Text shadows in CSS add depth and visual interest to text by creating a blurred, offset copy of the text behind it. This effect is achieved using the `text-shadow` property, which allows you to specify the shadow's horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur radius, and color. Multiple shadows can be applied to a single text element, creating complex and layered effects.
