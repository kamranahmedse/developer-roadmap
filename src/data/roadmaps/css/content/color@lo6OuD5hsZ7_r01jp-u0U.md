# Color

Color in CSS is used to specify the foreground color of text and other elements. It can be defined using various methods, including named colors (like "red" or "blue"), hexadecimal values (like "#FF0000"), RGB values (like "rgb(255, 0, 0)"), RGBA values (which include an alpha channel for transparency), HSL values (hue, saturation, lightness), and HSLA values (which include an alpha channel for HSL).
