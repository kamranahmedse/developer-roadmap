# Tables

Tables in CSS are used to format tabular data on a webpage, arranging information into rows and columns. CSS provides properties to control the appearance of tables, including borders, spacing, alignment, and styling of individual cells, rows, and columns. These properties enable developers to create visually appealing and well-structured tables that present data effectively.
