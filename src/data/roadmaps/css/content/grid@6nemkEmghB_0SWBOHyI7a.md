Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for CSS, enabling you to control the placement and sizing of elements within a grid container. It divides a webpage into rows and columns, allowing precise positioning of content and creating complex layouts with ease. This method offers flexibility and control over element arrangement, surpassing traditional methods like floats or positioning.
