# Declaration

A declaration in CSS is a single statement that specifies a property you want to style and the value you want to assign to that property. It's the fundamental building block for applying styles to HTML elements. Each declaration consists of a property name (like `color` or `font-size`), followed by a colon (`:`), and then a value (like `red` or `16px`). Declarations are always placed inside a CSS rule set, within the curly braces `{}`.
