# Keyframe Animations

Keyframe animations in CSS allow you to control the intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence. Instead of just defining the start and end states, you can specify multiple points (keyframes) along the animation timeline, defining the styles an element should have at each point. This provides granular control over how an element's appearance changes over time, enabling complex and visually appealing animations.
