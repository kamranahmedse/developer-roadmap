# Outline

In CSS, the `outline` property draws a line around an element, outside the border. Unlike borders, outlines don't affect the element's dimensions or position in the layout. They are primarily used for highlighting elements, often for accessibility purposes like indicating focus. You can control the style, color, and width of the outline.
