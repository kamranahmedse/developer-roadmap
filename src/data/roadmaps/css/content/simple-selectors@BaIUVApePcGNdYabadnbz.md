# Simple Selectors

Simple selectors in CSS are the basic building blocks for targeting HTML elements you want to style. They directly select elements based on their name (like `p` for paragraphs), ID (using `#`), or class (using `.`). These selectors are straightforward and provide a fundamental way to apply styles to specific parts of your webpage.
