# Border

In CSS, the `border` property defines the line that surrounds an HTML element's content and padding. It controls the border's style (like solid, dashed, or dotted), width (thickness), and color. You can set all these properties at once using the shorthand `border` property, or individually using `border-style`, `border-width`, and `border-color`.
