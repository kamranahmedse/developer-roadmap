# Units with Functions

Units with functions in CSS allow you to dynamically calculate values for properties using functions like `calc()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `clamp()`. These functions enable you to perform mathematical operations and comparisons directly within your CSS, making your designs more flexible and responsive by adapting to different screen sizes and contexts. This helps in creating more dynamic and adaptable layouts.
