# CSS Specificity

CSS Specificity is the set of rules that browsers use to determine which CSS declarations apply to an element when multiple conflicting rules exist. It's essentially a weighting system that prioritizes certain CSS selectors over others, ensuring that the most relevant style is applied. Understanding specificity is crucial for controlling how your CSS styles are applied and resolving unexpected styling issues.
