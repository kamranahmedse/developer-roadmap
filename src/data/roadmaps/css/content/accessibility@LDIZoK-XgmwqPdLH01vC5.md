Accessibility in CSS focuses on creating web content that is usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. This involves using semantic HTML, providing alternative text for images, ensuring sufficient color contrast, and designing layouts that are navigable with assistive technologies like screen readers. By following accessibility best practices, developers can build inclusive websites that provide a better experience for all users.
