# RGB Colors in CSS

RGB in CSS allows you to define colors using the Red, Green, and Blue color model. You specify the intensity of each color component (Red, Green, and Blue) as a value between 0 and 255, or as a percentage from 0% to 100%. By combining different amounts of red, green, and blue, you can create a wide range of colors. For example, `rgb(255, 0, 0)` represents pure red, `rgb(0, 255, 0)` represents pure green, and `rgb(0, 0, 255)` represents pure blue.
