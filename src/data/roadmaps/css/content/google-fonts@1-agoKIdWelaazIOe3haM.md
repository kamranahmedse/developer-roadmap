# Google Fonts

Google Fonts is a free library of over a thousand different font families that you can easily use on your website. Instead of relying on the limited set of fonts that come pre-installed on a user's computer, you can link to Google's servers and use any font they offer. This allows for greater design flexibility and ensures that your website's typography looks consistent across different devices and operating systems.
