# Grouping Selectors

Grouping selectors in CSS allows you to apply the same styles to multiple HTML elements simultaneously. Instead of writing the same CSS rules for each element individually, you can list the selectors separated by commas. This makes your CSS code more concise and easier to maintain, as you only need to define the styles once for all the grouped elements.
