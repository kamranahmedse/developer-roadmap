# Background Position

Background position in CSS controls where a background image is placed within its element. It lets you specify the horizontal and vertical placement of the image, using keywords like `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `center`, or with numerical values (pixels, percentages, etc.) to fine-tune the exact location. This property is useful for aligning background images in specific ways, creating visual effects, or ensuring that important parts of the image are always visible.
