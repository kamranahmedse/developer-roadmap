# Box Model

The CSS box model describes how elements on a webpage are structured as rectangular boxes. Each box consists of content (text, images, etc.), padding (space around the content), a border (a line around the padding and content), and a margin (space around the border). Understanding the box model is crucial for controlling the size and spacing of elements on a webpage.
