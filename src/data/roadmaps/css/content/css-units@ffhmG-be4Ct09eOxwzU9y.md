# CSS Units

CSS units define the size of elements and properties in a webpage. They specify how measurements like width, height, font size, and margins are interpreted by the browser. These units can be absolute, like pixels (px) or centimeters (cm), or relative, like em, rem, or viewport units (vw, vh), allowing for flexible and responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.
