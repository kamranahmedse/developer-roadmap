# Sass

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is compiled into CSS. It extends the capabilities of basic CSS by allowing you to use features like variables, nesting, mixins, functions, and inheritance. This makes CSS more maintainable, organized, and efficient to write.
