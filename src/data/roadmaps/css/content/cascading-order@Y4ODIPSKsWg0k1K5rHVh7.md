# Cascading Order

Cascading order in CSS determines which styles are applied to an element when multiple conflicting rules target the same element. It's a set of rules that browsers follow to resolve these conflicts, prioritizing styles based on factors like importance, specificity, and source order. Understanding the cascading order is crucial for predicting and controlling how styles are applied to your web pages.
