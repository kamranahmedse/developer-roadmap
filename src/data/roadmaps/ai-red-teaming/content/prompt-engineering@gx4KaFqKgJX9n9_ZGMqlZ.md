# Prompt Engineering

For AI Red Teamers, prompt engineering is both a tool and a target. It's a tool for crafting inputs to test model boundaries and vulnerabilities (e.g., creating jailbreak prompts). It's a target because understanding how prompts influence LLMs is key to identifying prompt injection vulnerabilities and designing defenses. Mastering prompt design is fundamental to effective LLM red teaming.
