# Responsible Disclosure

(A critical practice for AI Red Teamers is responsible disclosure: privately reporting discovered AI vulnerabilities (e.g., a successful jailbreak, data leak method, or severe bias) to the model developers or system owners, allowing them time to remediate before any public discussion, thus preventing malicious exploitation.)
