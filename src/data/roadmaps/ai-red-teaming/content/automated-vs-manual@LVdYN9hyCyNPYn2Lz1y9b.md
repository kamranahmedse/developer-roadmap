# Automated vs Manual Testing

(AI Red Teaming typically employs a blend of automated tools (for large-scale scanning, fuzzing prompts, generating basic adversarial examples) and manual human testing (for creative jailbreaking, complex multi-stage attacks, evaluating nuanced safety issues like bias). Automation provides scale, while manual testing provides depth and creativity needed to find novel vulnerabilities.)
