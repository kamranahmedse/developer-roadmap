# Testing Platforms

(Platforms used by AI Red Teamers range from general penetration testing OS distributions like Kali Linux to specific AI red teaming tools/frameworks like Microsoft's PyRIT or Promptfoo, and vulnerability scanners like OWASP ZAP adapted for API testing of AI services. These platforms provide the toolsets needed to conduct assessments.)
