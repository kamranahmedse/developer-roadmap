# API Protection

AI Red Teamers rigorously test the security of APIs providing access to AI models. They probe for OWASP API Top 10 vulnerabilities like broken authentication/authorization, injection flaws, security misconfigurations, and lack of rate limiting, specifically evaluating how these could lead to misuse or compromise of the AI model itself.
