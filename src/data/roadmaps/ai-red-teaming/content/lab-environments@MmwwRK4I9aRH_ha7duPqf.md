# Lab Environments

(AI Red Teamers need environments to practice attacking vulnerable systems safely. While traditional labs (HTB, THM, VulnHub) build general pentesting skills, platforms are emerging with labs specifically focused on AI/LLM vulnerabilities, prompt injection, or adversarial ML challenges.)

Learn more from the following resources:

- [@platform@Gandalf AI Prompt Injection Lab](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/) - A popular web-based lab for prompt injection practice.
- [@platform@Hack The Box: Hacking Labs](https://www.hackthebox.com/hacker/hacking-labs) - General pentesting labs.
- [@platform@TryHackMe: Learn Cyber Security](https://tryhackme.com/) - Gamified cybersecurity training labs.
- [@platform@VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) - Provides vulnerable VM images for practice.
