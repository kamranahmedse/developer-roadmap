# Types of Routers

Next.js has two different routers:

- **App Router**: The newer router that supports new React features like Server Components.
- **Pages Router**: The original router, still supported and being improved.

Before Next.js 13, the Pages Router was the main way to create routes in Next.js. It's still supported in newer versions of Next.js, but Next.js recommends migrating to the new App Router to leverage React's latest features.
