# Why Frontend Frameworks?

Building modern web applications often involves managing complex user interfaces, handling data efficiently, and ensuring a smooth user experience. Frontend frameworks like React, Angular, and Next.js provide a structured approach to these challenges. They offer pre-built components, routing solutions, state management tools, and optimized build processes, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than reinventing the wheel. This leads to faster development cycles, more maintainable code, and ultimately, better web applications.
