# ESLint

ESLint is an open-source static code analysis tool for JavaScript that identifies problematic patterns and style issues in your code, helping to enforce coding standards and prevent bugs before they occur

Next.js provides an ESLint plugin, `eslint-plugin-next`, already bundled within the base configuration that makes it possible to catch common issues and problems in a Next.js application.
