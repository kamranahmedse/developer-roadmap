# Edge Runtime

The Edge Runtime is a lightweight JavaScript runtime environment based on V8, designed to execute code closer to the user. It allows you to run server-side logic, like API routes and middleware, on a globally distributed network of servers. This proximity reduces latency and improves the overall performance of your application by minimizing the distance data needs to travel.
