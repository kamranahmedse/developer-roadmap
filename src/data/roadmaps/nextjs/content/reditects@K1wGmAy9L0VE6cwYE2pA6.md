# Redirects in Next.js API Endpoints

Redirects in Next.js API endpoints allow you to send a user from one URL to another. This is useful for various scenarios, such as moving or renaming pages, handling temporary content changes, or guiding users to a different part of your application based on specific conditions. By sending an HTTP redirect response, the server instructs the client's browser to navigate to the new URL.
