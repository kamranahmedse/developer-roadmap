# Rendering Composition

Rendering composition is the practice of building complex user interfaces by combining smaller, reusable components. In Next.js, this is important because it allows you to strategically decide which parts of your application should be pre-rendered on the server for better performance and SEO, and which parts can be rendered on the client for dynamic interactivity. By composing components effectively, you can optimize the rendering strategy for each part of your application, leading to a faster and more efficient user experience.
