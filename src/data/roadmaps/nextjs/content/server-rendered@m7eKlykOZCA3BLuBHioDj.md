# Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique where a web application's initial HTML is generated on the server in response to a user's request. This pre-rendered HTML is then sent to the client's browser, allowing the user to see the content immediately, even before the JavaScript code is fully executed. This approach contrasts with client-side rendering, where the browser downloads a minimal HTML page and then uses JavaScript to render the content.
