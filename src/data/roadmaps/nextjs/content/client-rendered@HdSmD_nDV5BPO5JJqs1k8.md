# Client-Side Rendering in Next.js

Client-Side Rendering (CSR) means the browser receives a minimal HTML page from the server. The browser then downloads the JavaScript code, which is responsible for rendering the entire user interface. The JavaScript code fetches the data and dynamically generates the HTML content in the browser. This approach shifts the rendering workload from the server to the client's browser.
