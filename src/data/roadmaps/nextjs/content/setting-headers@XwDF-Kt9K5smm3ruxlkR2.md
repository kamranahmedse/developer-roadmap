# Setting Headers in Next.js Middleware

Middleware in Next.js allows you to run code before a request is completed. Setting headers within middleware enables you to modify the HTTP response headers, controlling aspects like caching, security policies, or custom information passed to the client. This provides a flexible way to manage response behavior based on incoming requests.
