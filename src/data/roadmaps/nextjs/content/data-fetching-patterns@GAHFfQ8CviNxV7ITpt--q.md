# Data Fetching Patterns in Next.js

There are a few recommended patterns and best practices for fetching data in React and Next.js, including: 
* Fetching data on the server.
* Fetching data only where it's necessary.
* Using React's streaming and Suspense features to progressively render and incrementally stream rendered units of the UI to the client.
* Using parallel or sequential fetching depending on your particular use case.
* Using preload data.
