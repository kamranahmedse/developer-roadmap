# Global CSS

Next.js provides several ways to style your application using CSS. One example is Global CSS, which refers to CSS styles that are applied across your entire application. This means that the styles defined in a global CSS file will affect all elements on every page of your website, unless specifically overridden by more specific CSS rules. It's a way to establish a consistent look and feel throughout your project.
