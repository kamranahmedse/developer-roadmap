# Streaming in Next.js API Endpoints

Streaming in Next.js API endpoints allows you to send data to the client in chunks, rather than waiting for the entire response to be generated on the server before sending anything. This can significantly improve perceived performance, especially for long-running processes or when dealing with large datasets. By sending data incrementally, the client can start processing and displaying information sooner, leading to a more responsive user experience.
