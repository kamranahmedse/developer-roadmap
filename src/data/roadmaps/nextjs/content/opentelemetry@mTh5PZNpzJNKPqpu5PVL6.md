# OpenTelemetry

Observability is crucial for understanding and optimizing the behavior and performance of your Next.js app. With observability, developers can proactively address issues before they become major problems and provide a better user experience. 

Next.js recommends using OpenTelemetry for instrumenting your apps. It's a platform-agnostic way to instrument apps that allows you to change your observability provider without changing your code. Next.js supports OpenTelemetry instrumentation out of the box, which means that we already instrumented Next.js itself.
