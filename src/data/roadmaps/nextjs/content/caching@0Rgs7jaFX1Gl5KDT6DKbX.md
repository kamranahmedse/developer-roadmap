# Caching API Endpoints in Next.js

When you don't know the exact route segment names ahead of time and want to create routes from dynamic data, you can use Dynamic Segments that are filled in at request time or prerendered at build time. One example is catch-all segments, which allow you to extend API Routes  to catch all subsequent paths.
