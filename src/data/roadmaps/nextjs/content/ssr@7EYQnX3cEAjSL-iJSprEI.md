# Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique where a web application's HTML is generated on the server in response to each user request. The server then sends the fully rendered HTML to the client's browser, which displays it. This differs from client-side rendering, where the browser downloads a minimal HTML page and then uses JavaScript to render the content.
