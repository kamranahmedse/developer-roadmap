# Using Cookies in Next.js Middleware

Cookies are small pieces of data that websites store on a user's computer to remember information about them, such as login details, preferences, or shopping cart items. In Next.js middleware, you can access and modify these cookies before a request is handled by your application's routes, allowing you to implement features like authentication, personalization, and A/B testing based on cookie values. This provides a powerful way to control the user experience at the edge.
