# Static Export

Next.js enables starting as a static site or Single-Page Application (SPA), then later optionally upgrading to use features that require a server. Since Next.js supports static exports, it can be deployed and hosted on any web server that can serve HTML/CSS/JS static assets. This includes tools like AWS S3, Nginx, or Apache.

Running as a static export does not support Next.js features that require a server.
