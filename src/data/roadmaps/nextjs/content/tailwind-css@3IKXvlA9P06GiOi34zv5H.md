# Tailwind CSS

Next.js support Tailwind CSS to style your apps. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes that you can use to style your HTML elements directly in your markup. Instead of writing custom CSS rules, you compose styles by applying these utility classes, allowing for rapid UI development and consistent design. This approach promotes a more streamlined workflow by reducing the need to switch between HTML and CSS files.
