# Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting and to build scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it efficient and well-suited for real-time applications.
