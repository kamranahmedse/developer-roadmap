# Single-Page Application (SPA) Rendering

A Single-Page Application (SPA) is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates that page as the user interacts with the application. This is achieved by using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) directly, rather than requesting new HTML pages from the server for each interaction. This approach provides a more fluid and responsive user experience, as the browser doesn't need to reload the entire page for every change.
