# Runtimes and Types

In the context of Next.js, runtime refers to the set of libraries, APIs, and general functionality available to your code during execution. On the server, there are two runtimes where parts of your application code can be rendered:

* The Node.js Runtime (default), which has access to all Node.js APIs and is used for rendering your application.
* The Edge Runtime which contains a more limited set of APIs, used in Middleware.
