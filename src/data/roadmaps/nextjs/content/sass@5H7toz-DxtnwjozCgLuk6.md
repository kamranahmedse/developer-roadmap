# Sass in Next.js

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of standard CSS. It allows you to use features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions to write more organized, maintainable, and efficient stylesheets. These features are then compiled into standard CSS that browsers can understand.

Next.js has built-in support for integrating with Sass after the package is installed using both the `.scss` and `.sass` extensions. You can use component-level Sass via CSS Modules and the `.module.scss` or `.module.sass` extension.
