# Analytics

Next.js has built-in support for measuring and reporting performance metrics. You can either use the useReportWebVitals hook to manage reporting yourself, or alternatively, Vercel provides a managed service to automatically collect and visualize metrics for you.

For more advanced analytics and monitoring needs, Next.js provides a instrumentation-client.js|ts file that runs before your application's frontend code starts executing. This is ideal for setting up global analytics, error tracking, or performance monitoring tools.
