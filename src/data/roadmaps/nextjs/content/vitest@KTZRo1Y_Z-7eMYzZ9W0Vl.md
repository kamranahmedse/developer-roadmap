# Vitest

Next.js allows you to use Vitest for unit testing. Vitest is a fast unit test framework powered by Vite. It offers a development experience similar to Vite, making it easy to set up and use in projects that already use Vite for building. Vitest focuses on speed and simplicity, providing features like instant hot module replacement (HMR) and built-in support for TypeScript and JSX.
