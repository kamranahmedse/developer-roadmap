# Pages Router

The Pages Router in Next.js is a file-system based router built around the `pages` directory. Each file in the `pages` directory becomes a route based on its file name. For example, a file named `about.js` would create a route at `/about`. This approach simplifies routing by automatically mapping files to routes, making it easy to create and manage different pages within your application.
