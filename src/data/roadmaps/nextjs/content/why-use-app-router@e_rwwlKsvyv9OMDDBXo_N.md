# App Router

The App Router in Next.js is a new routing system built on React Server Components, offering enhanced flexibility and performance compared to the traditional Pages Router. Before Next.js 13, the Pages Router was the main way to create routes in Next.js. It's still supported in newer versions of Next.js, but Next.js recommends migrating to the new App Router to leverage React's latest features.
