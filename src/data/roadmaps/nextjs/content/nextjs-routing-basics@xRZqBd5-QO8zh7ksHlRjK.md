# Next.js Routing Basics

Routing is the process of defining how an application responds to client requests to specific endpoints (URIs). In Next.js, routing is primarily file-system based. This means that the structure of your `pages` directory directly corresponds to the routes of your application. Each file in the `pages` directory becomes a route based on its filename. For example, a file named `about.js` in the `pages` directory will be accessible at the `/about` route.
