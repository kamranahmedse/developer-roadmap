# Server-Side Data Fetching for Locations

Fetching data on the server in Next.js allows you to retrieve location information before the page is rendered. This approach improves performance by reducing the amount of work the client's browser needs to do, leading to faster initial page loads and better SEO. Server-side data fetching ensures that the data is available when the page is initially rendered, providing a seamless user experience.
