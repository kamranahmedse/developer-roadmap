# Lazy Loading

Lazy loading in Next.js helps improve the initial loading performance of an application by decreasing the amount of JavaScript needed to render a route. It allows you to defer loading of Client Components and imported libraries, and only include them in the client bundle when they're needed. For example, you might want to defer loading a modal until a user clicks to open it.
