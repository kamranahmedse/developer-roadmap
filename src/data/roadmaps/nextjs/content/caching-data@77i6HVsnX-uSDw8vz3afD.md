# Caching Data

Caching data in Next.js involves storing the results of data fetches so that subsequent requests for the same data can be served faster. Instead of repeatedly fetching data from a database or API, Next.js can retrieve it from the cache. This improves performance and reduces the load on your data sources. Caching can be configured at different levels.

Caching behavior changes depending on whether the route is statically or dynamically rendered, data is cached or uncached, and whether a request is part of an initial visit or a subsequent navigation. Depending on your use case, you can configure the caching behavior for individual routes and data requests.
