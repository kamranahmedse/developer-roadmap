# Why Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides extra features and optimizations beyond what React offers on its own. When choosing a framework built on React, Next.js stands out because it simplifies development with features like built-in routing, server-side rendering, and static site generation. These capabilities improve performance, SEO, and the overall developer experience compared to building a React application from scratch or using other frameworks that require more manual configuration.
