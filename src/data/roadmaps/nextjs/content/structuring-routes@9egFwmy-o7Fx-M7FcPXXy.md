# Structuring Routes

Structuring routes in Next.js involves organizing your project's file system to define the different URLs (or routes) of your application. Each file within the `app` directory (or `pages` directory in older versions) corresponds to a specific route. The file's location and name directly determine the URL path that users will access. This file-system-based routing simplifies navigation and makes it easy to create a well-organized web application.
