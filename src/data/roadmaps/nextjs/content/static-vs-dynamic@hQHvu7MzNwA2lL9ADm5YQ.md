# Static vs Dynamic API Endpoints

API endpoints in Next.js allow you to create serverless functions that handle requests. These endpoints can be either static or dynamic, depending on how their routes are defined and how they process data. Static API endpoints have predefined routes and typically return the same response for every request, while dynamic API endpoints use parameters in their routes to handle different requests and generate responses based on those parameters.
