# JavaScript Basics

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to websites. It allows you to create dynamic content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more. Think of HTML as the structure of a house, CSS as the interior design, and JavaScript as the electrical system that makes everything work. Understanding JavaScript is crucial before diving into Next.js because Next.js is built on top of React, which itself is a JavaScript library. Without a solid grasp of JavaScript fundamentals, you'll find it difficult to understand and effectively use Next.js's features and concepts.
