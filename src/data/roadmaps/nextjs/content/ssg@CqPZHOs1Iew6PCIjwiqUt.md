# Static Site Generation (SSG)

Static Site Generation (SSG) is a rendering method that generates HTML pages at build time. This means that when a user requests a page, the server sends a pre-rendered HTML file, rather than dynamically generating it on each request. This approach leads to faster load times and improved SEO, as search engines can easily crawl and index the static content.
