# Middleware Use Cases

Middleware in Next.js allows you to run code before a request is completed. This provides a flexible way to modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, adding headers, or even directly responding. Common use cases include authentication, authorization, redirecting users based on their location (localization), handling bots, and implementing advanced security measures.
