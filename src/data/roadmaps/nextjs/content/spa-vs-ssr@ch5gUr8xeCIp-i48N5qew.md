# SPA vs SSR

Single-Page Applications (SPAs) load a single HTML page and dynamically update the content using JavaScript, providing a fluid user experience without full page reloads. Server-Side Rendering (SSR), on the other hand, generates the HTML on the server for each request, sending a fully rendered page to the client. Next.js allows you to choose between these approaches or even combine them, offering flexibility in optimizing for performance, SEO, and user experience.
