# Intercepting Routes

Intercepting routes allows you to load a route from another part of your application within the current layout. This routing paradigm can be useful when you want to display the content of a route without the user switching to a different context. For example, when clicking on a photo in a feed, you can display the photo in a modal, overlaying the feed.
