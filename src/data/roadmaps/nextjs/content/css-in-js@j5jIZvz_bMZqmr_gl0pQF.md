# CSS in JS

It's possible to use any existing CSS-in-JS solution in your existing Next.js Apps and Pages. CSS-in-JS is a technique where CSS styles are written in JavaScript files instead of separate CSS files. This approach allows you to use JavaScript's dynamic capabilities to manage and scope your styles, often using libraries that generate CSS at runtime or build time. It offers benefits like component-level styling, dynamic theming, and easier management of CSS dependencies.
