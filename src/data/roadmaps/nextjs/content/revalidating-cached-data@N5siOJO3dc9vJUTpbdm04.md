# Revalidating Cached Data

Revalidation is the process of updating cached data. When you cache data, it's stored for a certain period. After that period, or based on specific events, you might want to refresh the data to ensure your application displays the most up-to-date information. Revalidation allows you to control when and how your cached data is updated, balancing performance with data freshness. Revalidating in Next.js is conducted through the `revalidatePath` and `revalidateTag` functions.
