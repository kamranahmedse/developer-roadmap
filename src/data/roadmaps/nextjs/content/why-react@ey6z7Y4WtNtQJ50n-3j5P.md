# Why React?

React is a JavaScript library designed for building user interfaces in a declarative and component-based way. It simplifies the process of creating dynamic and interactive web applications by allowing developers to break down complex UIs into smaller, reusable pieces. This approach promotes code maintainability, reusability, and efficiency, making it easier to manage and update large-scale frontend projects. React also works with tools like Redux for data management and React Native for mobile apps. It's popular because it's clear, fast, and has a big community.
