web3.js is a collection of JavaScript libraries that allows you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP, WebSocket, or IPC. It provides a set of functions to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, send transactions, read blockchain data, and manage Ethereum accounts. Essentially, it acts as a bridge between your JavaScript application and the Ethereum network.
