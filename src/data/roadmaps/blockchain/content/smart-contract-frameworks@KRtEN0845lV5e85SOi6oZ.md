# Smart Contract Frameworks

Smart contract frameworks are tools that provide a structure and set of libraries to help developers write, test, and deploy smart contracts more efficiently. They typically include features like automated testing, deployment scripts, and standardized contract structures, reducing boilerplate code and improving the overall development experience. These frameworks streamline the process of building decentralized applications (dApps) by offering pre-built components and best practices.
