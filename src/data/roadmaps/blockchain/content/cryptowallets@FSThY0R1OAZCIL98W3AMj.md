# Cryptowallets

Cryptowallets are tools that allow users to manage, store, and transact with cryptocurrencies. They don't actually hold the cryptocurrency itself; instead, they store the private keys needed to access and control your digital assets on the blockchain. These wallets come in various forms, including software, hardware, and paper, each offering different levels of security and convenience.
