# DAOs

DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, are essentially internet-native organizations governed by rules encoded as computer programs (smart contracts) on a blockchain. These rules dictate how the organization operates, and decisions are made through proposals and voting by DAO members, often using tokens that represent ownership or voting rights. This system aims to create a transparent and democratic structure where control is distributed rather than centralized.
