# Hybrid Smart Contracts

Hybrid smart contracts combine the benefits of blockchain-based smart contracts with external data and computation. They leverage on-chain code for core logic and security, while using off-chain oracles to access real-world information and perform complex computations that are impractical or impossible to execute directly on the blockchain. This allows smart contracts to interact with the outside world and create more sophisticated and versatile applications.
