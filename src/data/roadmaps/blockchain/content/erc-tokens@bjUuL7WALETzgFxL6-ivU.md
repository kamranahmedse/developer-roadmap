# ERC Tokens

An ‘Ethereum Request for Comments’ (ERC) is a document that programmers use to write smart contracts on Ethereum Blockchain. They describe rules in these documents that Ethereum-based tokens must comply with. While there are several Ethereum standards. These ERC Ethereum standards are the most well-known and popular: ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-777.
