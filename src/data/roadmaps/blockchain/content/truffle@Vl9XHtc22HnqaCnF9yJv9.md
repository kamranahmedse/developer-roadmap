# Truffle

Truffle is a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It helps developers build, test, and deploy smart contracts with ease. It provides features like contract compilation, linking, deployment, and automated testing. However, Consensys, the company behind Truffle, announced the sunset of Truffle and Ganache in November 2023, shifting focus to other tools.
