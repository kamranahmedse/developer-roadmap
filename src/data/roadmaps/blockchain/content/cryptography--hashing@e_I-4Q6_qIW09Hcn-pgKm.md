# Cryptography & Hashing

Cryptography is the art of secure communication, using techniques to encrypt (scramble) messages so only the intended recipient can read them. Hashing is a process that takes any input and produces a fixed-size string of characters, called a hash. This hash acts like a unique fingerprint of the input data. Even a tiny change to the original input will result in a drastically different hash.
