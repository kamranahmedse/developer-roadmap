Cryptography is the art of secure communication. It involves techniques for encrypting messages, making them unreadable to anyone except the intended recipient who possesses the key to decrypt them. It also provides methods for verifying the authenticity and integrity of data, ensuring that it hasn't been tampered with and that it truly comes from the claimed source.
