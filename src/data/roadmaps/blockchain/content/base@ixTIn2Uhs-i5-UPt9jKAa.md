# Base

Base is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain developed by Coinbase. It's designed to offer a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly environment for building decentralized applications (dApps). Base aims to scale Ethereum by processing transactions off-chain and then settling them on the main Ethereum network, thereby reducing gas fees and increasing transaction speeds.
