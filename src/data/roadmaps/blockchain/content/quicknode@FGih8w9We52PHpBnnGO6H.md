# QuickNode

QuickNode is a platform that provides infrastructure and tools for developers to build and run blockchain applications. It simplifies the process of connecting to blockchain networks by offering pre-configured nodes and APIs, eliminating the need for developers to set up and manage their own blockchain infrastructure. This allows developers to focus on building the actual application logic rather than dealing with the complexities of blockchain node management.
