# Fantom

Fantom is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) smart contract platform that provides decentralized, scalable, and secure services. It's designed to overcome the limitations of older blockchain technologies, particularly in terms of transaction speed and cost. Fantom uses its own consensus mechanism called Lachesis, which allows for near-instant transaction finality and high throughput.
