# Cardano

Cardano is a third-generation, open-source, decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project. It uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros, designed to be more energy-efficient and scalable than proof-of-work systems. Cardano aims to provide a secure and sustainable platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, with a focus on peer-reviewed research and a layered architecture.
