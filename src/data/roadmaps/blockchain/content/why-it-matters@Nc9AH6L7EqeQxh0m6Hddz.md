# Why Blockchain Matters

Blockchain technology provides a secure and transparent way to record and share information across a network. It works by grouping data into blocks, which are then cryptographically linked together in a chain. This structure makes it extremely difficult to alter or tamper with the data, as any change would require altering all subsequent blocks. This inherent security and immutability are key to its significance.
