# Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) is a system's ability to function correctly even when some of its components fail or act maliciously by providing incorrect information. It addresses scenarios where nodes in a distributed network can exhibit arbitrary behavior, including lying, forging data, or simply not responding. BFT algorithms aim to ensure that the system as a whole can still reach a correct and consistent decision despite these faulty nodes.
