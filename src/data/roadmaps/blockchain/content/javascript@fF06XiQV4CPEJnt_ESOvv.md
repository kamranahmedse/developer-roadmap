# JavaScript for dApps

JavaScript is a programming language that makes websites interactive. It's what allows buttons to work, animations to play, and data to be updated without reloading the page. For decentralized applications (dApps), JavaScript is essential because it's the primary language used to build the front-end, or user interface, that users interact with. It also connects the front-end to the blockchain, allowing users to send transactions and retrieve data from the decentralized network.
