# Ethereum

Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized blockchain platform that establishes a peer-to-peer network for securely executing and verifying application code, referred to as smart contracts. It enables participants to transact with each other without a trusted central authority. Transactions on Ethereum are grouped into blocks, which are then cryptographically linked together to form a chain, ensuring data integrity and immutability.
