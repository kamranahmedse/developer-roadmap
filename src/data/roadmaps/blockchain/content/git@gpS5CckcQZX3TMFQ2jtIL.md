# Git

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files in a project over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same codebase simultaneously, managing different versions and merging changes efficiently. Git enables developers to revert to previous states, compare modifications, and maintain a detailed history of all project updates.
