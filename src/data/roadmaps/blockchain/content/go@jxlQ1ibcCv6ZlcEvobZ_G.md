# Go (Golang) for dApps

Go, often referred to as Golang, is a programming language known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrency. It's designed to be easy to learn and use, while also providing the performance needed for complex systems. For decentralized applications (dApps), Go's speed and ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously make it well-suited for building the backend logic, smart contracts, and other components that require high performance and reliability.
