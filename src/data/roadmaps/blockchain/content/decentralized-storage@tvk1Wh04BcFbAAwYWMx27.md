# Decentralized Storage

Decentralized storage is where data is stored on a decentralized network across multiple locations by users or groups who are incentivized to join, store, and keep data accessible. The servers used are hosted by people, rather than a single company. Anyone is free to join, they are kept honest due to smart contracts, and they are incentivized to participate via tokens.
