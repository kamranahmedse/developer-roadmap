# Vyper

Vyper is a contract-oriented, Pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It's designed with security as a primary focus, aiming to make it harder to write insecure smart contracts. Vyper achieves this through features like limited mutability, no modifiers, and mandatory bounds checking.
