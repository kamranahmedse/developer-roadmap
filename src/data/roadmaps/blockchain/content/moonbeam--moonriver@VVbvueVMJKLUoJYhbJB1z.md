# Moonbeam / Moonriver

Moonbeam and Moonriver are developer-friendly blockchain environments designed to be compatible with Ethereum's tooling and ecosystem. Moonbeam operates as a smart contract parachain on the Polkadot network, while Moonriver serves as its "canary network" on Kusama, providing a real-world testing ground for new code. Both platforms allow developers to easily deploy existing Solidity-based smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) from Ethereum with minimal changes.
