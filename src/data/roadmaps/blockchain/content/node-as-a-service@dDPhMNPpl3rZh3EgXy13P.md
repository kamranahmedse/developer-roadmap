# Node as a Service

Node as a Service (NaaS) provides access to blockchain nodes without requiring users to set up and maintain their own infrastructure. Instead of running a node directly, developers can connect to a node provided by a third-party service. This allows them to interact with the blockchain, read data, and broadcast transactions without the complexities of node management.
