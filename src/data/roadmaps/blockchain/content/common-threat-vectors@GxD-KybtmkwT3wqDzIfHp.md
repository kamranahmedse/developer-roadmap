# Common Threat Vectors

Smart contracts, while powerful, are susceptible to various vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. These weaknesses, known as threat vectors, can lead to loss of funds, data manipulation, or denial of service. Common examples include reentrancy attacks, where a contract recursively calls itself before completing its initial execution, and integer overflows/underflows, which can cause unexpected behavior due to arithmetic errors. Other threats involve timestamp dependence, where contracts rely on block timestamps that can be manipulated by miners, and denial-of-service attacks that can make a contract unusable. Understanding these threat vectors is crucial for writing secure and reliable smart contracts.
