# Version Control Systems

Version control systems are tools that manage changes to code and other files over time. They allow multiple people to collaborate on a project without overwriting each other's work, track the history of modifications, and revert to previous versions if needed. These systems essentially create a detailed record of every change made to the project, making it easier to understand who made what changes and when.
