# Gosh

Gosh is a development platform that is purpose-built for securing the software supply chain and extracting the value locked in projects. It is the first blockchain-based platform for software development, which allows developers and businesses to create products in a familiar, straightforward, and safe way. On Gosh, every operation, commit, and transaction is trustless, traceable, and transparent. This means that developers can build composable, censorship-resistant repositories, and monetize their open source projects by turning them into a DAO.
