# Testing dApps

Testing decentralized applications (dApps) involves verifying that the smart contracts and user interfaces function correctly and securely. This process ensures that the dApp behaves as expected under various conditions, including normal usage, edge cases, and potential attacks. Effective testing helps identify and fix bugs, vulnerabilities, and performance issues before deployment, leading to a more reliable and trustworthy application.
