# Proof-of-Work (PoW)

Proof-of-Work is a mechanism used to confirm transactions and add new blocks to a blockchain. It involves solving a complex computational puzzle, requiring significant processing power and time. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block to the chain and is rewarded with cryptocurrency. This process makes it computationally expensive to tamper with the blockchain, ensuring its security and integrity.
