# Ethereum 2.0

Ethereum 2.0, also known as Serenity, represents a major upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain. It transitions the network from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system called Casper, aiming to improve scalability, security, and sustainability. This upgrade also introduces sharding, which divides the blockchain into multiple smaller, more manageable pieces to increase transaction throughput.
