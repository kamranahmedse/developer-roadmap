# Crypto Wallets

Crypto wallets are tools that allow users to manage and interact with their cryptocurrencies. They don't actually store the crypto themselves; instead, they store the private keys needed to access and control your digital assets on the blockchain. These wallets enable users to send, receive, and store cryptocurrencies, as well as interact with decentralized applications (dApps).
