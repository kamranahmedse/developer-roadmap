# Solidity

Solidity is a programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a high-level, contract-oriented language whose syntax is similar to JavaScript, C++, and Python, making it relatively accessible to developers familiar with these languages. Solidity allows developers to define the logic and rules that govern the behavior of smart contracts, including how they store data, handle transactions, and interact with other contracts.
