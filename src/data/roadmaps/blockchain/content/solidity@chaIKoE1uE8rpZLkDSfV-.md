# Solidity

Solidity is an object-oriented programming language created specifically by Ethereum Network team for constructing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum. It's used to create smart contracts that implements business logic and generate a chain of transaction records in the blockchain system. It acts as a tool for creating machine-level code and compiling it on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
