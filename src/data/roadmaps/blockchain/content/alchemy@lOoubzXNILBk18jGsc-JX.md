# Alchemy

Alchemy is a platform that provides developers with the infrastructure and tools needed to build and scale decentralized applications (dApps). It simplifies the process of interacting with blockchain networks by offering reliable and scalable APIs, enhanced monitoring, and developer tools that abstract away the complexities of running and maintaining blockchain nodes. This allows developers to focus on building the application logic rather than managing the underlying infrastructure.
