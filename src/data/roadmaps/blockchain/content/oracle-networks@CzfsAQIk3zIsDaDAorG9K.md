# Oracle Networks

Oracle networks are groups of independent oracles that work together to provide data to a blockchain. Instead of relying on a single source of information, these networks aggregate data from multiple oracles, enhancing reliability and security. This redundancy helps to mitigate the risk of inaccurate or manipulated data being fed into smart contracts, making the overall system more robust.
