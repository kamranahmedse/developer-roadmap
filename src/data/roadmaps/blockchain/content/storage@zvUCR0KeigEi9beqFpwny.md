# Decentralized Storage

Decentralized storage in blockchain involves distributing data across a network of computers instead of relying on a single, central server. Each computer in the network holds a piece of the overall data, making it more resistant to censorship, single points of failure, and data loss. This distributed approach enhances security and availability, as the data remains accessible even if some nodes go offline.
