# Plasma

Plasma is a framework for building scalable decentralized applications (dApps) on top of a parent blockchain, like Ethereum. It essentially creates "child chains" that operate independently but are anchored to the main chain for security. These child chains can process transactions much faster and cheaper than the main chain, and periodically commit summaries of their activity to the parent chain, ensuring data integrity and dispute resolution.
