# Code Coverage

Code coverage is a metric that measures the extent to which the source code of a program is executed when a test suite is run. It helps identify areas of the code that are not being tested, potentially revealing bugs or vulnerabilities that might otherwise go unnoticed. It's expressed as a percentage, indicating the proportion of code lines, branches, or paths that have been exercised by the tests.
