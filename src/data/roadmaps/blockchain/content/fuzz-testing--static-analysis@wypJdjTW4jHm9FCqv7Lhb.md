# Fuzz Testing & Static Analysis

Fuzz testing involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as input to a program to identify potential vulnerabilities and bugs. Static analysis, on the other hand, examines the source code of a program without actually executing it, looking for potential errors, security flaws, and coding standard violations. Both techniques are used to improve the robustness and security of software.
