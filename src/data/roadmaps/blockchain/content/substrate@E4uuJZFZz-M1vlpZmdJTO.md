# Substrate

Substrate is a modular framework for building blockchains. It provides a set of pre-built components and libraries that developers can use to create custom blockchains tailored to specific needs, rather than building everything from scratch. It offers flexibility in designing consensus mechanisms, runtime logic, and networking protocols, making it suitable for a wide range of blockchain applications.
