# Venom

The Venom Foundation is the first crypto foundation licensed in UAE's ADGM and is set to launch its blockchain platform soon. The platform uses asynchronous blockchain technology of dynamical sharding, which enables boundless scalability, higher security guarantees with decentralization, and manages the gross data transaction flows without faltering by increasing fees and transaction times. The foundation aims to develop and support a self-sufficient blockchain ecosystem with non-custodial wallet options, transparent transaction histories, interchain transactions, staking on validator nodes, and a native decentralized exchange, among others.
