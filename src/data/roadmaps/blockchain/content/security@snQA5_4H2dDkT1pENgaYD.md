# Security

Security is about protecting valuable information and assets from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. In blockchains, this means ensuring that transactions are valid, data is tamper-proof, and the system is resistant to attacks. Strong security is essential for maintaining trust and reliability in blockchain networks, as any vulnerability could lead to loss of funds, data breaches, or network failures.
