# What is Blockchain

A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across a network of computers. Each transaction, or group of transactions, is recorded in a "block," and these blocks are linked together in a chronological chain. This structure makes the blockchain resistant to modification, as altering any block would require changing all subsequent blocks and gaining consensus across the network.
