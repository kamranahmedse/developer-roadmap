# OpenZeppelin

OpenZeppelin is a library of secure, reusable smart contracts for Ethereum and other blockchain platforms. It provides implementations of common standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721, as well as security tools and best practices to help developers build decentralized applications (dApps) safely and efficiently. Think of it as a collection of pre-built, audited building blocks for smart contract development.
