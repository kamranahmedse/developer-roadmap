# Blockchain Structure

A blockchain is essentially a distributed, immutable ledger composed of blocks chained together chronologically. Each block contains a batch of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block. This hash links the blocks together, creating a chain and ensuring that any alteration to a previous block would change its hash and invalidate all subsequent blocks, thus providing security and data integrity.
