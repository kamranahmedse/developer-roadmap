# Blockchain Forking

Blockchain forking happens when a blockchain diverges into two or more separate chains. This typically occurs when there's a change to the blockchain's protocol or software, and not all nodes agree on or adopt the new rules. As a result, some nodes continue following the old rules, while others follow the new ones, leading to the creation of parallel blockchains that evolve independently.
