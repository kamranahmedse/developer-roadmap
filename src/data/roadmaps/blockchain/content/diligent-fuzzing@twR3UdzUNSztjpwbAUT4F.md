# Manticore

Manticore is a symbolic execution tool used for analyzing smart contracts and binary programs. It works by exploring all possible execution paths of a program, identifying potential vulnerabilities like integer overflows, underflows, and other security flaws. This allows developers to automatically detect and fix bugs before deployment.
