# Cryptography

Cryptography, or cryptology, is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. Cryptography is the technique of protecting information and communications by using codes, so that only those intended to receive the information can read and process it. It involves various algorithms and protocols to secure communication by converting plain text into unreadable formats, making it incomprehensible to unauthorized parties.
