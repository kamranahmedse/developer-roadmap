# NFTs

NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique digital assets that represent ownership of items. These items can be anything digital, like artwork, music, or virtual real estate, or even real-world assets. Each NFT has a unique identifier, making it distinct and irreplaceable, unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are fungible (interchangeable). This uniqueness allows NFTs to be used to prove authenticity and ownership in the digital realm.
