# Sidechains

Sidechains are separate blockchains that are linked to a main blockchain (often called the "mainchain" or "parent chain"). They operate independently but can communicate with the mainchain, allowing assets and data to be transferred between them. This enables the mainchain to offload some of its transaction processing and functionality to the sidechain, improving scalability and allowing for experimentation with new features without affecting the mainchain's stability.
