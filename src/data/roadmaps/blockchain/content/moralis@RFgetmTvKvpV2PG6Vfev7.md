# Moralis

Moralis is a development platform that simplifies the process of building decentralized applications (dApps). It provides a suite of tools and infrastructure, including a managed backend, authentication, and real-time data synchronization, allowing developers to focus on the front-end user experience and smart contract logic rather than managing complex server-side infrastructure.
