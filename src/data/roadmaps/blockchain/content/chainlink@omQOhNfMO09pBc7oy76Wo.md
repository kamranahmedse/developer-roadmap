# Chainlink

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides real-world data to smart contracts on a blockchain. It acts as a bridge, securely connecting blockchains to external data sources, APIs, and payment systems. This allows smart contracts to access information like price feeds, weather data, and event outcomes, enabling them to execute based on real-world conditions.
