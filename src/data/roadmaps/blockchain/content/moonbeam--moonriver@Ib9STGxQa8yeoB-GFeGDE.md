# Moonbeam / Moonriver

Moonbeam and Moonriver are developer-friendly blockchain platforms designed to operate as parachains within the Polkadot and Kusama networks, respectively. They provide an Ethereum-compatible environment, allowing developers to easily deploy existing Solidity-based smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) with minimal code changes. This compatibility simplifies the process of bringing Ethereum projects to the Polkadot ecosystem, leveraging its scalability and interoperability features.
