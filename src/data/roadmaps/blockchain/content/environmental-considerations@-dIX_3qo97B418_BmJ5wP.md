# Environmental Considerations

Blockchain technology, particularly certain types like those using Proof-of-Work, can consume significant amounts of energy. This energy consumption stems from the computational power required to validate transactions and secure the network. The environmental impact is primarily due to the carbon footprint associated with the electricity used, especially if that electricity is generated from fossil fuels. This has led to concerns about the sustainability of some blockchain applications and spurred research into more energy-efficient consensus mechanisms.
