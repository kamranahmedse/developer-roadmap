# Consensus Protocols

Consensus protocols are mechanisms that allow a distributed network of computers to agree on a single, consistent state of data. They ensure that all participants in the network can trust the information being shared, even when some participants might be unreliable or malicious. These protocols establish rules for how new information is added to the network and how conflicts are resolved, ultimately leading to a shared understanding of the truth.
