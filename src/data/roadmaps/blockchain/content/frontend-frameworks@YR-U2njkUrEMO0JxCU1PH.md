Frontend frameworks provide a structured way to build the user interface of a web application. They typically include pre-built components, styling conventions, and tools that simplify the development process, allowing developers to create interactive and responsive user experiences more efficiently. These frameworks handle many of the common tasks involved in frontend development, such as managing the user interface state, handling events, and rendering data.
