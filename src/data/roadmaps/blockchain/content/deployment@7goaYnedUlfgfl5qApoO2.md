# Smart Contract Deployment

Smart contract deployment is the process of taking a smart contract, written in a language like Solidity, and making it live and executable on a blockchain network. This involves compiling the code into bytecode, paying a transaction fee (gas) to the network, and storing the contract's bytecode and initial state on the blockchain. Once deployed, the smart contract becomes an immutable and autonomous program that can be interacted with by users and other contracts.
