# Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different units or components of an application work correctly together. They focus on testing the interactions between these components to ensure that data is passed correctly and that the overall system functions as expected when the parts are combined. This type of testing helps to identify issues that may arise when individual units are integrated, such as incorrect data formatting or communication errors.
