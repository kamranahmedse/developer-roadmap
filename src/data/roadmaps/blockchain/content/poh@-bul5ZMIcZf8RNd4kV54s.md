# Proof of History (PoH)

Proof of History (PoH) is a consensus mechanism that creates a historical record to prove that an event occurred at a specific moment in time. It uses a verifiable delay function (VDF) to generate a sequence of computations that are difficult to parallelize, meaning they must be executed in a specific order. This creates a tamper-proof and auditable timeline of events, allowing for faster and more efficient consensus in distributed systems.
