# Proof of Stake (PoS)

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a type of consensus mechanism used by blockchains to achieve agreement on the state of the network. In PoS systems, validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of tokens they "stake" or hold in the network. The more tokens a validator stakes, the higher their chance of being selected to propose the next block and earn rewards. This mechanism aims to be more energy-efficient than Proof of Work (PoW) by eliminating the need for complex computations.
