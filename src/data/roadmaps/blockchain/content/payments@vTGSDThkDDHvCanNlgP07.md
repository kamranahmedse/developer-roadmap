# Payments in dApps

Payments within decentralized applications (dApps) involve using cryptocurrencies or tokens to exchange value directly between users or between users and the dApp itself, without relying on traditional intermediaries like banks. This enables faster, more transparent, and often cheaper transactions compared to conventional payment systems. dApps can leverage smart contracts to automate payment processes, enforce payment terms, and create innovative financial models.
