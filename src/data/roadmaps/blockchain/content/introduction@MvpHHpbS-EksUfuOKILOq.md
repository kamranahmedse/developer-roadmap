# Blockchain

Blockchain is essentially a shared, immutable record of transactions or data, organized into blocks that are linked together chronologically using cryptography. Each block contains a hash of the previous block, creating a chain that is resistant to modification. This distributed ledger technology allows for secure and transparent data management without the need for a central authority.
