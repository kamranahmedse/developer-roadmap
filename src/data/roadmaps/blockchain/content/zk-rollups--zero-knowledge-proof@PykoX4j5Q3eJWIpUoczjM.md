# Zk Rollups & Zero Knowledge Proof

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are a cryptographic method where one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. ZK-rollups leverage this technology to bundle multiple transactions into a single batch, which is then verified using a ZKP on the main blockchain. This significantly reduces transaction costs and increases throughput, as the main chain only needs to verify the proof, rather than each transaction.
