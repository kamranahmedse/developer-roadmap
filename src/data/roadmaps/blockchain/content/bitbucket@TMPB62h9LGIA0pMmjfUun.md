# Bitbucket

Bitbucket is a web-based version control repository hosting service owned by Atlassian, the same company that makes Jira and Confluence. It's primarily used for source code management and collaborative development, allowing teams to store, track, and manage changes to their code. Bitbucket supports both Git and Mercurial version control systems and offers features like pull requests, branching, and issue tracking to streamline the software development workflow.
