# dApp Deployment

Deployment refers to the process of making a decentralized application (dApp) accessible and functional for users. This involves taking the code, smart contracts, and user interface components and placing them on the appropriate networks and servers so that users can interact with the dApp. It includes compiling smart contracts, migrating them to a blockchain network (like Ethereum), setting up the frontend hosting, and configuring any necessary backend services.
