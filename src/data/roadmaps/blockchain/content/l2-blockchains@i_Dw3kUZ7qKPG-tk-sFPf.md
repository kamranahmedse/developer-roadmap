# L2 blockchains

Layer-2 refers to a network or technology that operates on top of an underlying blockchain protocol to improve its scalability and efficiency. This category of scaling solutions entails shifting a portion of Ethereum's transactional burden to an adjacent system architecture, which then handles the brunt of the networkâ€™s processing and only subsequently reports back to Ethereum to finalize its results.
