# Layer 2 Blockchains

Layer 2 blockchains are built on top of an existing blockchain (Layer 1) to improve scalability and efficiency. They handle transactions off-chain, reducing the burden on the main chain and allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. After processing, the Layer 2 chain submits a summary or proof of the transactions to the Layer 1 chain for final settlement and security.
