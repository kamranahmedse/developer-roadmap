# Echidna

Echidna is a Haskell program designed for fuzzing/property-based testing of Ethereum smart contracts. It generates random sequences of calls to the contract and checks if certain user-defined properties hold true after each sequence. This helps developers uncover unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities in their smart contract code.
