# Security Practices

Security practices are the established methods, procedures, and guidelines implemented to protect systems, data, and assets from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. These practices encompass a wide range of measures, including access controls, encryption, vulnerability management, incident response, and security awareness training, all designed to minimize risks and maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
