# Blockchain Networks

Blockchain networks are the underlying infrastructure that allows blockchains to operate. They are essentially distributed ledgers shared among multiple participants. There are four main types: _public blockchains_, which are permissionless and open to anyone; _private blockchains_, which are permissioned and controlled by a single organization; _consortium blockchains_, which are also permissioned but governed by a group of organizations; and _hybrid blockchains_, which combine elements of both public and private blockchains.
