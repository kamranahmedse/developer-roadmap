# Blockchain Networks

Blockchain networks are the underlying infrastructure that allows blockchains to operate. They are essentially distributed ledgers shared among multiple participants. There are four main types: *public blockchains*, which are permissionless and open to anyone; *private blockchains*, which are permissioned and controlled by a single organization; *consortium blockchains*, which are also permissioned but governed by a group of organizations; and *hybrid blockchains*, which combine elements of both public and private blockchains.
