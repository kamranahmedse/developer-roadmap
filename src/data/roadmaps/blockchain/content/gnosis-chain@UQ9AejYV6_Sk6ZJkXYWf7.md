# Gnosis Chain

Gnosis Chain is a blockchain that's compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means it can run smart contracts and applications designed for Ethereum with relatively few changes. It operates as a separate blockchain, using its own consensus mechanism and currency, while still maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem.
