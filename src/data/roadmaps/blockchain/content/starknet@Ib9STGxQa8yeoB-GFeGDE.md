# Starknet

Starknet is a permissionless, decentralized Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution that operates on top of Ethereum. It uses a technology called STARKs (Succinct Transparent ARguments of Knowledge) to bundle multiple transactions together and process them off-chain, before submitting a single proof of validity back to the Ethereum mainnet. This significantly increases transaction throughput and reduces gas fees compared to directly interacting with Ethereum.
