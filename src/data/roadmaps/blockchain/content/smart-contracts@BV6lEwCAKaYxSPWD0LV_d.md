# Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing agreements written in code and stored on a blockchain. They automatically enforce the terms of a contract when predetermined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries. These contracts are immutable and transparent, ensuring that once deployed, they cannot be altered and their execution is verifiable by anyone on the network.
