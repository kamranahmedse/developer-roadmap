# TVM-Based Blockchains

TVM-based blockchains use the TON Virtual Machine (TVM) to execute smart contracts. TVM is designed for high performance and scalability, allowing these blockchains to handle a large number of transactions efficiently. It supports multiple programming languages and offers features like asynchronous message passing, enabling complex and decentralized applications to be built on the chain.
