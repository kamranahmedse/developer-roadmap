# TVM based

TVM-based blockchain is a type of blockchain that uses the Telegram Open Network Virtual Machine (TVM) for executing smart contracts. This allows for fast and efficient execution of smart contracts and enables developers to create decentralized applications.

BoC stands for Bag of Cells, and it refers to the data structure used in the TVM-based blockchain to store all the information related to a smart contract. This includes the code of the contract, its state, and other relevant data. The Bag of Cells is a highly efficient data structure that allows for fast and secure storage of smart contract data.
