# Optimism

Optimism is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It aims to improve transaction speeds and reduce costs on the Ethereum network by processing transactions off-chain and then bundling them back onto the main chain in a more efficient manner. It uses a technology called Optimistic Rollups, which assumes transactions are valid unless proven otherwise, streamlining the validation process.
