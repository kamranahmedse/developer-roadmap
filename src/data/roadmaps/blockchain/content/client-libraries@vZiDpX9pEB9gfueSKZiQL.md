# Client Libraries

Client libraries are collections of pre-written code that simplify how applications interact with a blockchain. They provide functions and tools to easily connect to a blockchain network, send transactions, retrieve data, and manage smart contracts, abstracting away the complexities of low-level blockchain communication. This allows developers to focus on building the application's logic rather than dealing with the intricacies of blockchain protocols.
