# Smart Contract Upgrades

Smart contract upgrades involve modifying or replacing existing smart contracts deployed on a blockchain. Since blockchains are immutable, directly altering a deployed contract is impossible. Instead, upgrade mechanisms typically involve deploying a new contract and migrating data and functionality from the old contract to the new one, ensuring minimal disruption and maintaining the integrity of the application.
