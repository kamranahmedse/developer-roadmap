# Rust

Rust is a multi-paradigm, high-level programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It achieves memory safety without garbage collection, making it suitable for systems programming and resource-constrained environments. Rust's ownership system and borrow checker prevent common programming errors like data races and dangling pointers at compile time.
