# Types of Blockchains

Blockchains come in different flavors, each with its own way of handling transactions and data. Some, like those based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), are designed for smart contracts and decentralized applications, allowing developers to build complex logic directly onto the blockchain. Others, like those using the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model (Bitcoin), focus on tracking ownership of digital assets through a chain of transactions. There are also variations in terms of permissioning, with public blockchains being open to anyone, and private or consortium blockchains restricting access to authorized participants.
