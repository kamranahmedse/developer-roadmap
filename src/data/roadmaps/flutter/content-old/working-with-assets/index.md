# Working with Assets

Assets are resources such as images, fonts, and other files that are included in your app. To use assets in Flutter, you need to specify them in your app's `pubspec.yaml` file and then access them in your code.

The `pubspec.yaml` file is used to manage dependencies, assets, and other settings in your Flutter app. The `flutter` section is used to specify assets that should be included with the app. The path specified in the `assets` section should be relative to the `pubspec.yaml` file.
