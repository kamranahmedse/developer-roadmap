# AnimatedWidget

AnimatedWidget is a Flutter widget that takes an `Animation` object as an argument and automatically updates whenever the animation changes. This can be useful when you want to create animations that are tightly coupled to a widget, for example, to animate the size or color of a widget. With `AnimatedWidget`, you can encapsulate the animation logic into a single widget and reuse it throughout your app. This makes it easier to manage and maintain your animations, as the animation code is centralized and decoupled from the widget tree.
