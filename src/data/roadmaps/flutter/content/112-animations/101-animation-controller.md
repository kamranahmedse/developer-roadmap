# AnimationController

This class lets you perform tasks such as:

- Play an animation forward or in reverse, or stop an animation.
- Set the animation to a specific value.
- Define the upperBound and lowerBound values of an animation.
- Create a fling animation effect using a physics simulation.

By default, an AnimationController linearly produces values that range from 0.0 to 1.0, during a given duration.
