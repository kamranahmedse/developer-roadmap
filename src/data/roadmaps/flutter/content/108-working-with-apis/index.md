# Working with APIs

Working with APIs in Flutter involves making HTTP requests to a server and processing the responses. Flutter provides a number of libraries for making HTTP requests, including `dart:io` and `http`.

The `http` library is a popular choice for making HTTP requests in Flutter, as it is easy to use and provides support for HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more.
