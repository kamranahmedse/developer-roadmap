# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for your API that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, and nothing more. It was developed by Facebook and released as open source in 2015.

One of the main benefits of GraphQL is that it allows the client to request specific fields on demand, rather than having the server determine what data to send in a fixed response format. This allows the client to request only the data it needs, reducing network traffic and improving the efficiency of the API.
