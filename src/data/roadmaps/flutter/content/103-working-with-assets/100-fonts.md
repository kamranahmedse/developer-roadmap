# Fonts

You can use custom fonts in your app by including the font file in your app's assets and specifying the font in your app's styles. To use a custom font:

- Add the font files to your app's assets folder.
- In your pubspec.yaml file, specify the fonts under the flutter section
- In your app's styles, specify the font family
- Use the font in a Text widget
