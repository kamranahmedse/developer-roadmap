# Images

In Flutter, you can display images using the `Image` widget. There are several ways to add an image to your app:

- Asset: Add the image to your app's assets and specify the asset path in the `Image` widget.
- Network: Display an image from a URL by specifying the URL in the `Image` widget.
- File: Display an image from a file by specifying the file path in the `Image` widget.

The `Image` widget also accepts additional parameters such as `fit`, `width`, and `height` to control the size and scaling of the image.
