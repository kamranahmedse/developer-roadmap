# OOP

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects," which are instances of a class. In OOP, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, which have both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). The main idea behind OOP is to model real-world objects and their interactions, making it well-suited for creating complex and large-scale software systems.
