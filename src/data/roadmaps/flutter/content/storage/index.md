# Storage

Flutter provides several options for persistent storage, some of which are as follow:

- SharedPreferences: A key-value store for small data.
- SQLite database: A relational database for structured data.
- File System: For storing large files and data.
- Firebase: A real-time database and backend as a service.

All of these storage options are supported through third-party packages, which are easily integrated into a Flutter app.
