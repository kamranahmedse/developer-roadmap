# Storage

In Flutter, you can use Firebase Storage to store and retrieve binary data, such as images, audio files, and videos. Firebase Storage is a cloud-based storage service provided by Firebase that makes it easy to store and serve large binary data, such as images and videos, in your Flutter app.

To use Firebase Storage in your Flutter app, you need to first create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console and then add the Firebase Storage package to your Flutter app.
