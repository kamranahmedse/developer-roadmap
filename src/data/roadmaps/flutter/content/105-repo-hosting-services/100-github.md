# Github

GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It is widely used by developers and organizations around the world to manage and collaborate on software projects.

With GitHub, you can:

- Store your code in a repository (repo) and version it using Git.
- Collaborate with other people on a project by sharing your repo and working together on code changes.
- Share your projects with the world by making your repos public.
- Use GitHub to discover new projects and contribute to existing ones by forking a repo, making changes, and submitting a pull request.
- Track issues and bugs, and manage projects with features like project boards, milestones, and wikis.

GitHub also provides a wide range of tools and services for developers, including GitHub Pages for hosting websites, GitHub Actions for automating workflows, and GitHub Marketplace for finding and integrating with third-party tools.
