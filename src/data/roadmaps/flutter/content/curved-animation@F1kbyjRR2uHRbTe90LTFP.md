# CurvedAnimations

Curved animations in Flutter can be achieved using the "CurvedAnimation" class. This class takes in a "Curve" object that defines the rate of change of the animation over time. The most commonly used curve is the "Curves.easeInOut" curve, which starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and then slows down again towards the end.
