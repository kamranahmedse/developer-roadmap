In Flutter, you can work with different file types besides images. Some common file types that you can use in Flutter include:

1. Text files: You can read or write text files using the dart:io library.
2. JSON files: You can parse JSON data using the dart:convert library.
3. Audio and Video files: You can play audio and video files using the video_player and audioplayers packages.
