# CI/CD

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a software development practice that helps to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying mobile apps, including Flutter apps.

With CI/CD, developers can automate the build, test, and deployment process for their Flutter apps, making it easier to catch bugs and deploy new features quickly and efficiently.

The key components of a CI/CD pipeline for a Flutter app are:

- Version control
- Automated builds
- Automated testing
- Deployment
