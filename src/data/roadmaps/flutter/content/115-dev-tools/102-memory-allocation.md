# Memory Allocation

Memory allocation is the process of reserving a portion of the device's memory for the use of your app. The memory allocation in Flutter is managed by the Dart virtual machine, which uses a garbage collector to automatically manage the memory used by the app.

In Flutter, the widgets in the app's widget tree represent the state of the app. When the state changes, the widgets are rebuilt and the previous state's memory is automatically collected by the garbage collector.
