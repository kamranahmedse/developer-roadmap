# Flutter Outline

Flutter Outline is a feature in the Flutter development environment (IDE) that provides a tree-like representation of the widgets and elements in your Flutter app. It shows the hierarchy of the widgets, their relationships, and the structure of your app.

The Flutter Outline can be used to:

- Navigate through your code
- Understand the widget hierarchy
- Debug your code
- Refactor your code

The Flutter Outline is a useful tool for Flutter developers, as it provides a high-level overview of your app and makes it easier to navigate and understand the code. It can help you to write better code and debug your app more efficiently.
