Segment is an analytics platform that provides a single API for collecting, storing, and routing customer data from various sources, including mobile apps built with Flutter.

With Segment, Flutter developers can easily add analytics tracking to their app, without having to integrate with multiple analytics tools individually. Segment acts as a single point of integration, allowing developers to send data to multiple analytics tools with a single API.
