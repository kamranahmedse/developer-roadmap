# Trees

A tree is a data structure that is used to represent the hierarchy of widgets in a Flutter app. The tree structure allows Flutter to manage the layout, styling, and behavior of the widgets in the app.

A Flutter app's widget tree is created by composing smaller widgets into larger ones, which are then added to the tree. The root node of the tree represents the entire app, while the other nodes represent individual widgets.
