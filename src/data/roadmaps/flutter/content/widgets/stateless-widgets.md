# Stateless Widgets

Stateless widgets in Flutter are widgets that don't maintain any mutable state. They are designed to be immutable and rebuild each time the framework needs to update the UI. They are suitable for static, unchanging views or simple animations. They can be created using the `StatelessWidget` class and have a single build method that returns a widget tree.
