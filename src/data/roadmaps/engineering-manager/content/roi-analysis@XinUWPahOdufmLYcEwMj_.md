# ROI analysis

An Engineering Manager leverages ROI (Return on Investment) analysis to ensure strategic objectives align with financial viability. They analyze projected costs and benefits related to engineering projects. Their key responsibilities include identifying potential risks and calculating the profitability of various alternatives based on expected returns.

Conducting an ROI analysis can pose challenges, including acquiring accurate data and quantifying soft benefits. An Engineering Manager may address these by systematic data gathering and using structured frameworks for quantification.

Success in ROI analysis requires skills in financial literacy, critical thinking, and data interpretation. A proactive approach, coupled with a comprehensive understanding of the business, allows Engineering Managers to effectively evaluate the economic impact of engineering decisions.
