# Role transitions

Role transitions often occur within an Engineering team, and an Engineering Manager has a crucial role managing these changes. They're responsible for making sure transitioning team members are clear about their new duties and have the support they need to fulfill them.

Challenges that arise with role transitions can include resistance to change, confusion, or even a decrease in productivity. Engineering Managers address these challenges through transparent communication, hands-on training, and creating a workspace that supports learning and adaptation.

Success in managing role transitions requires a mix of technical understanding, strong communication, and leadership skills. Periodic check-ins and feedback sessions are also useful for ensuring these transitions are effective and beneficial for all involved. This approach not only helps alleviate concerns but also aids in keeping team morale high during times of change.
