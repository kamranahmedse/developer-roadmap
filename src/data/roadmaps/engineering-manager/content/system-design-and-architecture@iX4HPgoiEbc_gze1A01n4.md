#  System Design and Architecture

An Engineering Manager leads and oversees the system design and architecture. They're responsible for ensuring that the design aligns with the company's business goals and client needs. Their tasks may include making key technical decisions, reviewing design proposals, architecting scalable systems, and ensuring systems' redundancy and fault tolerance.

Technical issues are common in system design and architecture. An Engineering Manager handles these by having a deep understanding of the systems and their dependencies. They must effectively communicate these complexities to their team and guide the problem-solving process.

The manager needs excellent problem-solving and communication skills. They need to understand the trade-off between design complexities, operational costs, and ease-of-use. This helps in creating systems that are efficient, user-friendly, and cost-effective.
