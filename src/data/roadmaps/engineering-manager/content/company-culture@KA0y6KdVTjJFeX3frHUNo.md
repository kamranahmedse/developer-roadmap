# Company Culture

An Engineering Manager plays a vital role in shaping and fostering the company culture. It's their task to ensure the culture aligns with the company's values and promotes a positive working environment. Healthy company culture can contribute to higher employee satisfaction, improved productivity, and lower turnover rates.

The main challenge in this respect is to maintain compatibility between the existing culture and the rapid technological changes. The Engineering Manager should lead by example and reinforce the desired attitudes and behavior.

To make this effective, strong communication and interpersonal skills are a prerequisite. An Engineering Manager should, therefore, be approachable, transparent, and solicit feedback to continuously improve the work environment and uphold a vibrant company culture.
