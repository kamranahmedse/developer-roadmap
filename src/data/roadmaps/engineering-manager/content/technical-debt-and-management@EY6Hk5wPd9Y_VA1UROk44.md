# Technical Debt and Management

Engineering Managers play a crucial role in managing technical debt. This involves identifying, prioritizing, and tackling issues. It's the manager's job to strike a balance between improving the existing codebase and delivering new features.

Addressing technical debt demands constant vigilance. Key responsibilities include conducting code reviews, advocating for coding standards, and allocating time for refactoring and updates. They face challenges like pushback from stakeholders and proper risk assessment.

Success in this area requires a mix of technical knowhow and leadership skills. An effective Engineering Manager maintains open communication about technical debt among team members and stakeholders. They leverage their actions towards ensuring the team's efforts align with the company's goals.
