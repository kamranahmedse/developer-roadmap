# Process changes

An Engineering Manager identifies the need for process changes, and oversees the implementation. They'll usually take the front seat in conducting technical reviews to evaluate current procedures. If there's an operational gap, they'll design and enforce a more efficient process.

Addressing implementation obstacles is another responsibility. This means the manager will handle resistance to change and maintain team morale. They'll often use clear communication to elucidate the reasons for the change, and the benefits it'll bring.

In order to land this successfully, an Engineering Manager needs good analytical skills to pinpoint the weak areas in the current processes, and excellent leadership and communication skills to facilitate the transition. They should also be flexible, to adapt the plan as the change progresses.
