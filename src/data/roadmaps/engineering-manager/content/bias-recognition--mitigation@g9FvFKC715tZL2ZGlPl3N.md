# Bias Recognition / Mitigation

An Engineering Manager shoulders the responsibility of shaping a team culture that empowers everyone equally. Recognizing and mitigating bias is both a pivotal and challenging part of this role. Ensuring that decisions aren't tainted by personal biases averts, for instance, unjust promotions or assignments.

Engineering Managers must remain receptive to feedback, acting upon it to uproot hidden biases. Here, communication skills, especially in conflict resolution, come in handy. A manager may also instigate diverse recruitment practices and training sessions to promote an understanding of bias.

The challenge lies in continuously maintaining awareness of personal blind spots and subconscious preconceptions. Regular introspection and seeking others' viewpoints can help a manager address this. In essence, it's about urging constructive change while fostering a culture that values fairness and inclusion.
