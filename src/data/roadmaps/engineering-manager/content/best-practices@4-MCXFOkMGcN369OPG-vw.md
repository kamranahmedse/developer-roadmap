# Best Practices

As an Engineering Manager, one key area you interact with is the best practices for documentation. This involves ensuring your team consistently maintains high-quality, easily readable, and efficiently structured documents. Importance is placed on keeping information up-to-date and easily accessible to facilitate quick decision-making and work efficiency.

One of your responsibilities is to instill an awareness in your team of the lasting impact of good documentation. Encourage them to take time in creating materials that not only help their current project but also aid future understanding. 

Challenges may emerge when documentation is seen as secondary to product development. Overcome this by emphasizing the long-term benefits of comprehensive documentation, like saving time on future projects and reducing technical debt. Ensure your team respects the 'write the docs' ideology where coding and documenting go hand-in-hand.
