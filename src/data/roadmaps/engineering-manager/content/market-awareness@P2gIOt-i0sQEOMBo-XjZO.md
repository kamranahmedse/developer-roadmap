# Market awareness

An Engineering Manager needs to have both technology and market awareness. By understanding the market trends, they can lead the team towards developing products or features that meet client needs and stand out from the competition. This involves close collaboration with the marketing, sales, and product management teams to incorporate market feedback into the engineering process.

The challenge often lies in balancing market demands with technical feasibility and team capacity. An effective approach is to maintain open communication channels with all stakeholders involved and conduct regular market trend analysis.

To do this job effectively, an Engineering Manager needs good analytical, communication and decision-making skills. They should also have the ability to grasp new market trends quickly and synthesize this information into actionable insights for their team.
