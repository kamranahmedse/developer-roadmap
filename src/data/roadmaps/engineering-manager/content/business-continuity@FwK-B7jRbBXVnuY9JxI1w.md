# Emergency Staffing

Emergency staffing refers to the process of quickly securing and deploying personnel to address unexpected and critical situations that disrupt normal operations. This involves identifying skill gaps, finding available resources (either internal or external), and rapidly onboarding them to mitigate the impact of the emergency and restore stability. The goal is to minimize disruption and maintain essential functions during a crisis.
