# Quality Metrics

Quality metrics are a crucial part of an Engineering Manager's role in project management. The responsibility here is two-fold: choosing the right metrics and interpreting them correctly for making data-driven decisions. Metrics like defect density, test pass rate, code review coverage, and more, can provide powerful insights into a project's health.

Engineering Managers might face challenges in selecting relevant metrics that would give a true measure of quality. This problem is solved by aligning the metrics with project goals and periodically re-evaluating them.

Being successful in this aspect requires an understanding of data analysis and a keen eye for detail. More importantly, an open-minded approach to consider all potential issues is beneficial. After all, quality metrics function best when they not only validate success but also unearth hidden problems.
