# Organization structure

An Engineering Manager must understand and navigate the organization structure with ease. As a key responsibility, they need to know the roles, responsibilities, and relationships of various teams and individuals within the organization. This awareness can aid in quality cross-functional collaboration and effective decision making.

Challenges may arise when there are changes in organizational structure, causing shifts in roles and responsibilities. Addressing this would involve frequent communication and adapting to the changes quickly. 

To be successful, the Engineering Manager needs excellent communication skills and the ability to foster strong relationships. An understanding of the organization's hierarchy and dynamics is crucial as well, to ensure the smooth flow of operations and project progressions.
