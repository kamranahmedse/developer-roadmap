# Security  Best Practices

As an Engineering Manager, ensuring security best practices is crucial. This involves creating and maintaining secure software infrastructure, and making sure the team is following proper protocols.  

Responsibilities include staying updated on latest security trends and threats, applying suitable security measures, and overseeing code reviews. It's also important for the manager to instill a security-minded culture within the team, ensuring developers are aware and attentive to security considerations.

Challenges can emerge from rapidly evolving threats and compliance issues. To overcome these, the manager often needs the ability to anticipate problems and devise effective solutions. Additionally, having strong leadership skills helps in including security practices as a primary concern in development processes. Regular training and updates about the latest security best practices is also an effective strategy to prepare the team to handle potential threats.
