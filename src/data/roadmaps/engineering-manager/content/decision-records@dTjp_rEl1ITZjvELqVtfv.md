# Decision records

An Engineering Manager plays a crucial role in preserving decision records. These records serve as valuable historical documents, they encapsulate reasons behind significant decisions made in projects. An Engineering Manager's key responsibilities include ensuring decision records are kept up to date, comprehensible and easily accessible. 

Challenges the manager may face can stem from inconsistent documentation or low prioritization of record keeping. To tackle these issues, they must foster a culture that values accuracy and promptness in documentation. 

Success in this aspect requires a consistent methodology and communication skills. Managers should introduce standard formats for decision records and promote their routine use. They need to guide their teams on the importance of records not just for looking back but for future project strategy as well.
