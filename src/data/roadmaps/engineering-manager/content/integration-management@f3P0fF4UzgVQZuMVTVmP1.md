# Integration management

An engineering manager in partner management has a critical role in managing integrations. Their responsibilities include overseeing the development of tools and technologies that facilitate seamless connectivity with partners, ensuring the integration process meets partner requirements and goals.

Engineering managers face challenges like dealing with complex integration scenarios, aligning technological needs, and handling communication between multiple teams. To succeed in this area, they need skills in API management, technical knowledge and the ability to communicate effectively.

An important approach here is proactive problem solving. An engineering manager will benefit from anticipating possible issues and implementing solutions ahead of time. This will make the integration process smoother and prevent major disruptions.
