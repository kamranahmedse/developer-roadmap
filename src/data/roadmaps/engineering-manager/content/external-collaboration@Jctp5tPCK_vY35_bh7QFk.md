# External collaboration

The role of an Engineering Manager extends to external collaboration as well. Here, they often serve the role of liaising with external teams, vendors, or partners, aligning goals and ensuring smooth communication flow. The key responsibilities include managing relationships, understanding the partner ecosystem, and negotiating win-win situations.

Engineering Managers face challenges like cultural differences, communication hurdles, or time zone disparities. They address these by building reliability through regular updates, clear agendas, and understanding each other's work culture.

To succeed, Engineering Managers need good interpersonal skills, a keen eye for future opportunities, and the ability to adapt quickly. An understanding of business and sales, alongside engineering knowledge, can be advantageous too. This role needs balance - drive details when necessary and step back and delegate when appropriate.
