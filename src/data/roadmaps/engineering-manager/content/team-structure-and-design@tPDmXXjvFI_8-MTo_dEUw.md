# Team Structure and Design

Team structure and design weigh heavily on an Engineering Manager's shoulders. Key responsibilities include determining the necessary roles, defining their right fit, and establishing efficient channels of communication. This foundation is fundamental to improving overall productivity and agile adaptability. 

Challenges include aligning team design to project demands while balancing individual talent and skill proficiencies. Managers often resolve these issues by identifying their teams' strengths, driving role clarity, and fostering a culture of open, honest feedback. 

Success in this area requires robust understanding of software development processes, emotional intelligence for effective interpersonal relationships, and strategic planning skill to design adaptable team structures. By dexterously aligning individual strengths to project needs, managers truly extract the maximum potential from their teams.
