# Process

Engineering management is a crucial role in tech companies, overseeing the processes that power engineering teams. An Engineering Manager has to ensure that all processes, be it software development lifecycles, testing protocols, or deployment procedures, are efficient, effective, and correctly implemented. 

A key responsibility they hold is identifying and managing any bottlenecks or hindrances slowing down productivity. This may involve constant monitoring, discussion with team members, and careful analysis of workflow data. The Engineering Manager's role also involves process optimization that can include introducing new tools, methodologies, or even reshaping teams for better performance. 

Success in this aspect requires exceptional problem-solving skills and the ability to innovate and adapt. Persistence and excellent communication skills are also required as effective process management often involves persuading and influencing others about the value of proposed changes.
