# Testing Strategies

Testing strategies form a crucial part of an engineering manager's domain. They are responsible for defining the approach that allows quick detection of flaws and ensures the production of quality software products. Their key responsibilities include selecting the proper testing methods, liaising with the development team to ensure adherence to established protocols, and managing resources for efficient testing.

Every engineering manager faces the challenge of implementing a robust testing strategy while balancing time and resources. To tackle this, they frequently use automated testing tools, risk-based testing, or integrate testing in continuous deployment models. 

To excel in managing testing strategies, an Engineering Manager not only requires a deep understanding of different testing methodologies and tools but also excellent communication skills to ensure every member of the team understands and follows the selected strategy.
