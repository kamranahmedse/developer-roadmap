# Vendor relationships

Engineering managers play a crucial role in maintaining robust vendor relationships. They are often responsible for choosing the right vendors, managing contracts, and ensuring the quality of services or goods provided.

One challenge they face is ensuring that the vendors adhere to the agreed service level agreements (SLAs) and standards. They handle this by setting clear expectations, maintaining open communication, and effectively managing vendor performance.

For success in this area, an engineering manager needs strong negotiation skills, good communication, and an understanding of contract management. A proactive approach to addressing issues and fostering a positive relationship is also beneficial. This ultimately helps the team get high-quality services and meet their goals.
