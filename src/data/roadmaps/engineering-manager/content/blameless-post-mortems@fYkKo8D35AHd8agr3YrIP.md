#  Blameless Post-mortems

An Engineering Manager plays a key role in facilitating blameless post-mortems. They bring teams together after incidents to dissect what went wrong, ensuring the main goal is learning, not pointing fingers.

The manager is responsible for promoting a no-blame culture. They ensure everyone opens up about their actions without fear or guilt. From this, they derive measures to stop similar incidents from happening. The manager thus carries the mantle of turning unfortunate mishaps into opportunities for team growth.

Challenges include overcoming the often human instinct to assign blame. To succeed, managers need astute conflict resolution, good listening skills, and a keen understanding of the engineering systems in play. The goal is improving systems, based on learnings, not pinpointing individual mistakes.
