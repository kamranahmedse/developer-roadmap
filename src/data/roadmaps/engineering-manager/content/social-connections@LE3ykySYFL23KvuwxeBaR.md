# Social connections

Creating and maintaining social connections within a team is a key focus for an Engineering Manager. It's their role to facilitate an environment that encourages bonding, which often involves organizing team-building events or casual gatherings. 

They face challenges like remote work preventing face-to-face interaction, and cultural or personality differences causing disconnect. To address these, they may use digital tools for virtual meetups, or implement diversity and inclusion training.

Their success in this aspect requires strong interpersonal and listening skills, empathy, and thoughtfulness. It helps to understand team dynamics and individual personalities. The aim is to build a team whose members know, trust, and respect each other, fostering a more collaborative and effective work culture.
