# Code Review Best Practices

An Engineering Manager has the responsibility to guide their team on code review best practices. They not only need to ensure the team is delivering quality code, but also that the process is efficient and educative. This involves creating a culture where constructive feedback is welcomed, and where discussing and learning about the codebase is a part of the daily routine.

Challenges could include conflicts among team members, varying levels of coding skills, or different understandings of code standards. To tackle these, the manager might need to step in and mediate discussions, offer training, or even set up some basic coding standards.

A successful Engineering Manager in this realm balances technical competency with strong communication and diplomatic skills, fostering a team environment where high quality code is a shared achievement.
