# Delegation

An Engineering Manager handles delegation by assigning tasks and responsibilities to team members based on their skill levels, strengths, and project needs. They must constantly balance the need to complete tasks efficiently against the need for team development. They face the challenge of assigning right-sized tasks that promote growth without overwhelming their team.

Key responsibilities in this area include discerning which tasks to delegate and to whom, and then clearly communicating expectations. Good delegation also involves tracking progress, providing support, and stepping in when necessary. 

Success in delegation requires strong communication skills, trust building, and talent recognition abilities. Also, the Engineering Manager must be risk-tolerant. They need to embrace that mistakes might occur and turn them into learning opportunities.
