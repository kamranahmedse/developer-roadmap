# Push Notifications

Push notifications in React Native allow you to send timely and relevant information to users even when they aren't actively using your app. The original native push notification functionality in React Native has been deprecated. Now, you'll typically rely on third-party services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), Expo Notifications, or OneSignal to handle the complexities of delivering notifications across different platforms (iOS and Android). These services provide robust APIs and infrastructure for managing device tokens, sending notifications, and tracking delivery success.
