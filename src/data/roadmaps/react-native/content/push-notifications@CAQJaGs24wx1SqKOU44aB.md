# Push Notifications
Push notifications in Expo/React Native allow you to send messages to users' devices even when your app isn't actively running. Expo simplifies this process by handling much of the complexity involved in communicating with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android and Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) for iOS
## The expo-notifications Library
The primary tool for implementing push notifications is the expo-notifications package, which provides an API to fetch push notification tokens, present notifications, schedule them, and respond to notification events. This library supports scheduling one-off notifications for specific dates, repeating notifications at intervals, managing application badge numbers, and fetching native device push tokens
