# Deep Linking

Deep linking in React Native allows your app to open and navigate to a specific screen or content when a user clicks on a URL or a custom URI scheme. It essentially creates a direct pathway into a particular section of your application, bypassing the typical app launch sequence and providing a more seamless user experience. This is useful for scenarios like opening a product page from a marketing email or directing users to a specific profile from a shared link.
