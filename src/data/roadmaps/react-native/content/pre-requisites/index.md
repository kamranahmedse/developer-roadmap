# Learn the Pre-requisites

Before you start learning React Native, you should have a basic knowledge of [JavaScript](/javascript) and [React](/react). You don't need to fully master these topics, but you should be familiar with them. Learn the basics of JavaScript (e.g. topics marked for beginners in [JavaScript Roadmap](/javascript) and continue with React Native. I have heard good things about official React Native documentation, so you can start there and pick up the relevant topics wherever needed.
