# Environment Setup

In React Native, setting up the development environment is a crucial step. The environment setup process includes installing and configuring various tools and packages required for developing, building, and launching a React Native application. There are two main approaches when setting up your React Native development environment:

## Expo CLI

Expo CLI is a command-line tool built for creating and managing React Native projects easily. It streamlines your development process by providing an entire development environment, including building and deploying your app to both iOS and Android platforms.

Visit the [Expo CLI Quickstart](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project) page for detailed instructions on how to set up your environment.

## React Native CLI

React Native CLI is the official command-line interface for building native mobile apps using React Native. This method requires you to manually set up the native development environment and tools needed for iOS and Android app development.
