# Expo

Expo is a framework and a platform that allows you to develop, build, and deploy React Native applications easily and quickly. It simplifies the development process and provides a set of useful tools and services, including its own CLI (Command Line Interface), a managed workflow, and an SDK (Software Development Kit) with pre-built modules for common features.

Visit the [Expo CLI Quickstart](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/) page for detailed instructions on how to set up your environment.
