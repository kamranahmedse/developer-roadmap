# CI/CD Pipelines

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying Cloudflare Workers. Common CI/CD platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and CircleCI can be used to create pipelines that automatically deploy Workers whenever code changes are pushed to a repository. These pipelines typically involve steps like linting, testing, building, and deploying using `wrangler`. Automating deployments ensures faster releases and reduces the risk of errors.
