# Prototypes

JavaScript is an object-oriented language built around a prototype model. In JavaScript, every object inherits properties from its prototype, if there are any. A prototype is simply an object from which another object inherits properties. To create complex programs using JavaScript, one has to be proficient in working with prototypes — they form the very core of OOP in the language.
