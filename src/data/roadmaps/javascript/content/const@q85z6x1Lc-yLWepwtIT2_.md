# [const] keyword

Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the `let` keyword. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator), and it can't be re-declared (i.e. through a variable declaration). However, if a constant is an object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed.
