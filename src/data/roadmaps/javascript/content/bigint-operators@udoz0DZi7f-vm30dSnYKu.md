# BigInt Operators

Most operators that can be used with the `Number` data type will also work with `BigInt` values (e.g. arithmetic, comparison, etc.). However, the unsigned right shift `>>>` operator is an exception and is not supported. Similarly, some operators may have slight differences in behaviour (for example, division with `BigInt` will round towards zero).
