# Debugging issues

When you're just starting with JavaScript development, you might use a lot of `console.log()` statements in your code to log and check the values of variables while debugging. The results of these would show up in the **Console** panel, along with a reference to the line and file of code which originated it.

However, for quicker, more complex, and easier debugging (which also doesn't litter your codebase with `console.log()`s), breakpoints and the sources panel is your friend.
