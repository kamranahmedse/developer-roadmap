# Debugging issues

When you're just starting out with JavaScript development, you might use a lot of `console.log()` statement in your code to log and check values of variables while debugging. The results of these would show up in the **Console** panel, along with a reference to the line and file of code which originated it.

However, for quicker, more complex and easier to handler debugging (which also doesn't litter your codebase with `console.log()`s), breakpoints and the sources panel is your friend.
