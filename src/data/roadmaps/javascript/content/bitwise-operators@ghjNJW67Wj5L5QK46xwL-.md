# Bitwise operators

Bitwise operators treat arguments as 32-bits (zeros & ones) and work on the level of their binary representation.
Ex. Decimal number `9` has a binary representation of `1001`. Bitwise operators perform their operations on such binary representations, but they return standard JavaScript numerical values.

Bitwise operators in JavaScript are as follows:

- `&` (AND)
- `|` (OR)
- `^` (XOR)
- `~` (NOT)
- `<<` (Left SHIFT)
- `>>` (Right SHIFT)
- `>>>` (Zero-Fill Right SHIFT)
