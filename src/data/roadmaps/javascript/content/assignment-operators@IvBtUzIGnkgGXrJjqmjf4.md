# Assignment Operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (`=`), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, `x = f()` is an assignment expression that assigns the value of `f()` to `x`.
