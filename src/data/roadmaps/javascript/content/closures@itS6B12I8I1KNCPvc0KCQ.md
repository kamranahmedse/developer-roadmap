# Closures

Function closures are one of the most powerful, yet most misunderstood, concepts of JavaScript that are actually really simple to understand. A closure refers to a function along with its lexical environment. It is essentially what allows us to return a function `A`, from another function `B`, that remembers the local variables defined in `B`, even after `B` exits. The idea of closures is employed in nearly every other JavaScript program, hence, it's paramount for a JavaScript developer to know it really well.
