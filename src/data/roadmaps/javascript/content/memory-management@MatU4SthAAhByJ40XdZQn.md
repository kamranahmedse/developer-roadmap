# Memory Management

Low-level languages like C, have manual memory management primitives such as `malloc()` and `free()`. In contrast, JavaScript automatically allocates memory when objects are created and frees it when they are not used anymore (garbage collection). This automaticity is a potential source of confusion: it can give developers the false impression that they don't need to worry about memory management.
