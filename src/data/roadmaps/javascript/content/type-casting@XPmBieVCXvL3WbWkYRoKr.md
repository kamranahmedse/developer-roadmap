# Type Casting

Type conversion (or typecasting) means the transfer of data from one data type to another. Implicit conversion happens when the compiler (for compiled languages) or runtime (for script languages like [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript)) automatically converts data types. The source code can also explicitly require a conversion to take place.
