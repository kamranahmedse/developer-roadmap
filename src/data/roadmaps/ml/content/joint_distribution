## JOINT DISTRIBUTION 

- *A joint distribution is a statistical distribution that describes the probability of two or more random variables occurring together. It provides a complete picture of the relationships between the variables and is used in a variety of fields such as machine learning, finance, and engineering*.

### USES:

Joint distributions have various applications in different fields. Here are some common uses of joint distributions:

1 . Probability Analysis: Joint distributions are used to study the probability of two or more random variables occurring together. 

2 .This makes them useful in analyzing the likelihood of events happening simultaneously, which is crucial in decision making, risk management, and data analysis.
