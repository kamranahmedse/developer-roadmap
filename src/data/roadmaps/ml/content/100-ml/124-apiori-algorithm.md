# APRIORI ALGORITHM

Apriori algorithm is given by R. Agrawal and R. Srikant in 1994 for finding frequent itemsets in a dataset for boolean association rule. Name of the algorithm is Apriori because it uses prior knowledge of frequent itemset properties. We apply an iterative approach or level-wise search where k-frequent itemsets are used to find k+1 itemsets. To improve the efficiency of level-wise generation of frequent itemsets, an important property is used called Apriori property which helps by reducing the search space.
All these are the perfect examples of Association Rules. It can also be applied in the medical field to determine which symptoms tend to co-exist and help in diagnosis and speedy recovery. It is one of the methods of data mining.
