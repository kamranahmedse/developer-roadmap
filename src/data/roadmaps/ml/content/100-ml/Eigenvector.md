# Eigen vectors

In linear algebra, the eigenvectors of a square matrix are non-zero vectors which when multiplied by the square matrix would result in just the scalar multiple of the vectors. i.e., a vector v is said to be an eigenvector of a square matrix A if and only if A v = λ v, for some scalar λ.

Almost all vectors change direction when they are multiplied by a transformation matrix suppose $A$. There are certain vectors $x$ that will give same direction when multiplied by $A$ and will be stretched by some scalar $lambda$. Thus, the vector $x$ is called the eigen vector and the scalar $lambda$ is called the eigen value.
