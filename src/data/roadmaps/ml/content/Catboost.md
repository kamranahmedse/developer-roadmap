# Catboost Resources

CatBoost is an open-source gradient boosting framework that can handle categorical features in data. It is designed for high accuracy, fast training, and includes built-in regularization techniques, feature importance analysis, and an easy-to-use interface. CatBoost is particularly useful for solving problems related to image and text data. Its ability to handle categorical features without prior encoding sets it apart from other machine learning frameworks. Overall, CatBoost is a powerful and versatile tool for machine learning applications .
