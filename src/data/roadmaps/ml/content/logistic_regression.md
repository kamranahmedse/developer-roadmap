# logistic regression

Logistic regression is a statistical technique used to predict a binary outcome, such as yes/no or true/false, based on one or more input variables. It estimates the probability of the outcome using a sigmoidal function and applies a logit transformation to create a linear relationship. Logistic regression is commonly used in machine learning, predictive analytics, and other fields to classify data and make informed decisions based on the predicted probability of a binary outcome.
