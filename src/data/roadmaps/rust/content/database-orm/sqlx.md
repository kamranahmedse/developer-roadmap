# sqlx

`SQLx` is an extensible, async, pure-Rust SQL toolkit and ORM that provides a suite of macros and builders for interacting with databases. It enables you to interact directly with your database without having to write SQL-statements, but with the strong typing of Rust. SQLx supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MSSQL and is compatible with the `tokio` and `async-std` async runtimes. SQLx ensures compile-time checking of your SQL queries, which significantly reduces runtime errors due to malformed SQL.
