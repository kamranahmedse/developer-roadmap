# Actix

Actix is a powerful, pragmatic, and extremely fast web framework for Rust. It is based on Actix actor's framework, built around a small and simple API focused on making the creation of web applications straightforward and efficient. Its capable middleware system allows for highly customizable processing of web requests, making it versatile for a wide range of web development tasks. With support for WebSockets and server-sent events included, integration of real-time communication is quite seamless in Actix. Despite its high-level abstractions and ease of use, Actix does not compromise on performance, delivering some of the fastest processing times among Rust web frameworks.
