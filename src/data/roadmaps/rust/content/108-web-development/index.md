# Web Development

Web Development in Rust is a growing field, given the programming language's emphasis on safety and performance. In Rust, web development may involve using frameworks like Rocket, Poem, Actix or Tide to build web applications. There are also powerful web servers like Hyper that are built in Rust. Building web applications in Rust can involve facilitating client-server communication, handling HTTP requests, building routing systems, and managing databases among the other general tasks associated with web development. The Rust ecosystem provides tools to manage all these tasks and more.
