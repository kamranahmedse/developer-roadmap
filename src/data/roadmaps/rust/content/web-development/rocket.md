# Rocket

"Rocket" is a web framework for the Rust programming language that makes it simple to write fast, secure web applications without sacrificing flexibility, usability, or type safety. It provides a significant amount of functionality out-of-the-box, such as request routing, template rendering, form validation, and more. Rocket's philosophy revolves around usability and intuitiveness; it emphasizes clear and expressive syntax, detailed error messages, and powerful abstractions. Despite these aids, Rocket doesn't shield you from the complexities of web programming, but instead offers tools and interfaces to make these complexities manageable.
