# hyper

"Hyper" is a fast, safe and concurrent HTTP client and server written in Rust. It uses a non-blocking I/O model for efficient execution, leverages the Tokio platform for event-driven, asynchronous I/O, and includes support for HTTP/2. It has a modular design, allowing you to choose the features you need. Hyper also features a server-side framework for building your own HTTP applications. For security and speed, it comes with native support for HTTP/1 and HTTP/2, and automatically negotiates these protocols. Most importantly, it is designed from the ground up to take advantage of Rust's memory safety and concurrency features.
