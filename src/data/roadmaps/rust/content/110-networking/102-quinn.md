# quinn

`Quinn` is a Rust networking library providing high-level access to the QUIC protocol. It is built on top of the `tokio` runtime and implements the QUIC transport protocol as specified by the IETF. It provides an async, futures-based API for working with QUIC connections and streams. It is designed to offer high performance with robustness and flexibility, supporting both client and server roles. The QUIC protocol itself is a multiplexed and secure transport protocol positioned as a modern alternative to TCP, offering better performance for many networking applications.
