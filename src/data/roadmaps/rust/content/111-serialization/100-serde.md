# Serde

"Serde" is a framework in Rust that enables the serialization and deserialization of data structures. It provides a way to convert your data structures from Rust into a format that can be stored or sent over the network, and vice versa, in a flexible and straightforward manner. Despite its convenience, Serde avoids compromising on speed, and it is super-efficient. The library supports a variety of data formats, like JSON, Bincode, TOML, YAML, and more. Serde's design allows you to customize serialization and deserialization in intricate ways if the default behavior doesn't suit your application's needs.
