# IDEs and Rust Toolchains

For the Rust Programming Language, several Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and editors provide great support. Visual Studio Code is highly preferred among Rust developers due to its support for Rust via the "Rust Language Server" or "rust-analyzer" plugins. Another popular choice is RustRover, a dedicated IDE for Rust development by JetBrains. Additionally, Sublime Text and Atom with respective Rust-enhancement plugins are also used. For a more terminal-centric approach, Vim and Emacs are equipped with Rust modes. These IDEs and editors offer various features like auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools which prove useful for Rust programming.
