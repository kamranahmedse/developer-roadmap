# Testing

"Testing" in Rust is a crucial part of any programming project. This procedure involves creating specific scenarios to determine whether your code functions as expected. Rust has built-in support for this via the `cargo test` command which will run your test functions. These test functions are typically marked with the `#[test]` attribute to signify that they are not regular functions but testing adjuncts. Rust also provides a few macros such as `assert!`, `assert_eq!`, and `assert_ne!` for comparison checks and confirming expected behavior.
