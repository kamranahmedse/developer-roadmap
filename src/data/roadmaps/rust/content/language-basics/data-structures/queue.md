# Queue

In Rust, a Queue is another important linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order given to the elements follows the FIFO (First In First Out) approach. There are no direct standard library data structures meant solely to act as a Queue in Rust, but we can obtain queue-like behaviors using other provided data structures. More commonly, the VecDeque structure is used as a Queue. It supports constant time element insertion and removal at both ends. The 'push_back' and 'pop_front' functions essentially form a Queue structure.
