# Code Organization and Namespacing

In Rust, the fundamental structure for organizing your code is through using a **module** system and **crates**. A module in Rust allows grouping of related function definitions and struct definitions in a named scope. It’s defined using the `mod` keyword. The modules can also be nested and make code more concise, readable, and manageable. On the other hand, a **crate** is a binary or a library project in Rust. It's the largest compilation unit of Rust. It's a tree of modules that produces a library or executable. The crate root is a source file which the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate (e.g. `main.rs` or `lib.rs`).
