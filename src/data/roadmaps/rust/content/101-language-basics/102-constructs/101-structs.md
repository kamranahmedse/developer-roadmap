# Structs

In Rust, `struct` is a custom data type used for grouping related values together into one entity. It is similar to classes in other programming languages. Essentially, they create a new type that we can use to streamline complex data handling. There are three types of `struct` in Rust - classic `C` structs, tuple structs, and unit structs. Classic `C` structs are named-field struct and are the most commonly used. Tuple struct, while not being common, are useful when you want to couple together a few data points. Unit structs are useful in situations where you want to implement a trait on some type but don’t have any data that you want to store in the type itself.
