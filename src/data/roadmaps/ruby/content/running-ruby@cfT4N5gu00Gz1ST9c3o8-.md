Running Ruby code involves executing instructions written in the Ruby programming language. This can be done through various methods, including using the Ruby interpreter directly from the command line, executing Ruby scripts, or running Ruby code within a web server environment like Rails. The interpreter reads and executes the code line by line, producing the desired output or performing the specified actions.
