# Assignment Operators

Assignment operators in Ruby are used to assign values to variables. The most basic assignment operator is the equals sign (=), which assigns the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side. Ruby also provides compound assignment operators that combine assignment with arithmetic or bitwise operations, such as +=, -=, \*=, /=, and %=. These operators modify the variable's value by performing the specified operation with the right-hand side operand and then assigning the result back to the variable.
