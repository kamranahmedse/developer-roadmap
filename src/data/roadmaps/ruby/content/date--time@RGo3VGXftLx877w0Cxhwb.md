# Date & Time

Date and Time represent specific points in time. They allow you to work with dates (year, month, day) and times (hour, minute, second) and perform operations like calculating durations, formatting dates for display, and comparing different points in time. They are essential for handling events, scheduling tasks, and managing temporal data.
