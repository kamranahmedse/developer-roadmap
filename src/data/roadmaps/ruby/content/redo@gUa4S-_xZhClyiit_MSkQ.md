# Redo

`redo` is a control flow statement in Ruby used within loops (like `for`, `while`, `until`) and iterators (like `each`, `map`). When `redo` is encountered, it restarts the current iteration of the loop or iterator from the beginning, without evaluating any remaining code in that iteration. It essentially repeats the current step.
