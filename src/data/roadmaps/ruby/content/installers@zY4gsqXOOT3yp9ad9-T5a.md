# Installers

Installers are software packages designed to simplify the process of setting up Ruby on your computer. They typically handle downloading the necessary files, configuring your system environment, and ensuring that Ruby and its related tools are ready to use. Using an installer avoids the complexities of manual installation, making it easier for beginners to get started with Ruby development.
