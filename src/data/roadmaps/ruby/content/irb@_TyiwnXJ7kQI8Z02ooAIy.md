# Debugging with IRB

IRB (Interactive Ruby) is a powerful tool for debugging Ruby code. It allows you to execute Ruby code line by line, inspect variables, and test code snippets in real-time. This interactive environment helps you understand how your code behaves, identify errors, and experiment with different solutions without having to run your entire program. You can use IRB to step through your code, set breakpoints, and examine the state of your application at any point during execution.
