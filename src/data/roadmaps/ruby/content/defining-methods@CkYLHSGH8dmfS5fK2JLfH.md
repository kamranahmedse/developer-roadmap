# Defining Methods

Methods, also known as functions in other programming languages, are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. Defining a method involves specifying its name, the parameters it accepts (if any), and the sequence of instructions it executes. This allows you to organize your code into logical units, making it more readable, maintainable, and reusable throughout your program.
