# Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. They provide a way to control the flow of your program, enabling it to make decisions and respond differently to various inputs or situations. Common conditional statements include `if`, `elsif`, `else`, and `unless`.
