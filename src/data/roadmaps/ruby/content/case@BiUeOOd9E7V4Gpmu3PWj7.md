# Case Statements

A `case` statement in Ruby provides a way to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable or expression. It's an alternative to using multiple `if/elsif/else` statements, especially when you need to check for several different possible values. The `case` statement compares a given value against multiple `when` clauses, and executes the code block associated with the first matching clause. An optional `else` clause can be included to handle cases where none of the `when` clauses match.
