# For Loop

The `for` loop in Ruby provides a way to iterate over a sequence of values, such as elements in an array or a range. It executes a block of code for each item in the sequence. While functional, the `for` loop is not as commonly used in Ruby as other iteration methods like `each`, `map`, or `select`, which are often considered more idiomatic and flexible.
