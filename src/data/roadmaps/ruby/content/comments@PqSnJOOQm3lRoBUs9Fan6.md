# Comments

Comments are notes in your code that the Ruby interpreter ignores. They're used to explain what the code does, making it easier for you and others to understand. You can create a single-line comment by starting a line with a `#`. For multi-line comments, you can use `=begin` and `=end` blocks; anything between these markers is treated as a comment.
