# Data Types

Data types are classifications that specify which type of value a variable can hold and what operations can be performed on it. They define the kind of data, such as numbers, text, or boolean values, that can be stored and manipulated within a program. Understanding data types is fundamental to writing correct and efficient code, as it allows the program to handle different kinds of information appropriately.
