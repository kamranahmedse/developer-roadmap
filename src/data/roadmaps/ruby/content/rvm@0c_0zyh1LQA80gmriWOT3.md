# RVM

RVM (Ruby Version Manager) is a command-line tool that allows you to easily manage multiple Ruby environments on a single system. It enables you to install, manage, and work with different Ruby versions (like Ruby 2.7, 3.0, or JRuby) and gemsets (isolated collections of gems) independently. This prevents conflicts between projects that require different Ruby versions or gem dependencies.
