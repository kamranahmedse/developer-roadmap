# Lambdas

Lambdas are anonymous functions, meaning they are functions without a name. They are objects in Ruby and can be treated like any other object, such as being passed as arguments to methods or stored in variables. Lambdas are defined using the `lambda` keyword or the shorthand `->` syntax, and they are similar to procs but differ in how they handle arguments and `return` statements.
