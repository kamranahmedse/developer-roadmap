# Mutex

A mutex (mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive that provides exclusive access to a shared resource. It essentially acts as a lock, ensuring that only one thread or process can access a critical section of code at any given time. This prevents race conditions and data corruption that can occur when multiple threads try to modify the same data simultaneously.
