# RuboCop

RuboCop is a static code analyzer and formatter for Ruby. It inspects Ruby code and reports style issues, potential errors, and code smells based on a community-driven Ruby style guide. RuboCop can also automatically correct many of these issues, ensuring code consistency and improving overall code quality.
