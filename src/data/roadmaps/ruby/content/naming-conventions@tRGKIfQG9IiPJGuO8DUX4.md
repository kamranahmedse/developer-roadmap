# Naming Conventions

Naming conventions are a set of rules or guidelines for choosing names for variables, methods, classes, and other entities in a programming language. These conventions promote code readability, maintainability, and consistency across projects. Following a standard naming style helps developers understand the purpose and scope of different elements within the code more easily.
