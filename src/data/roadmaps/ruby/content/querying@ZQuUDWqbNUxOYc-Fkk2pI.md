# Querying Enumerable Collections

Enumerable querying methods in Ruby allow you to gather information _about_ a collection without necessarily extracting or transforming its elements. These methods check for the presence of elements that meet certain conditions, determine the size or characteristics of the collection, or verify if all or any elements satisfy a given criteria. They return boolean values, counts, or other summary data about the Enumerable itself, rather than returning a modified Enumerable.
