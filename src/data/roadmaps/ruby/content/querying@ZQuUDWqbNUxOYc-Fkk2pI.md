# Querying

`Enumerable` comes with some methods that allow you to search and filter elements within a collection based on specific conditions. These methods return elements that match your criteria, providing a way to extract relevant data from a larger set. This allows you to efficiently find specific items or subsets of items within a collection without manually iterating through each element.
