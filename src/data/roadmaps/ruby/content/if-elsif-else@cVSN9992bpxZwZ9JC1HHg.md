# Conditional Statements (if, elsif, else)

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. The `if` statement executes a block of code if a condition is true. The `elsif` statement (optional) allows you to check additional conditions if the initial `if` condition is false. The `else` statement (optional) provides a block of code to execute if none of the preceding conditions are true.
