# Ranges

Ranges in Ruby are used to create a sequence of values. They are defined using two endpoints, which can be numbers, characters, or any objects that can be compared using the `<=>` operator. Ranges can be inclusive (including the last value) or exclusive (excluding the last value), denoted by `..` and `...` respectively. They are commonly used for iterating over a sequence, creating subsets of arrays, and checking if a value falls within a specific interval.
