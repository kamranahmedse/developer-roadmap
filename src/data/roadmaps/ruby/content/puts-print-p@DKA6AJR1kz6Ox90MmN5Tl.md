# Puts, Print, and P

`puts`, `print`, and `p` are methods in Ruby used to display output to the console. `puts` prints the given arguments followed by a newline character, `print` prints the arguments as they are without adding a newline, and `p` prints a human-readable representation of the given object, which is useful for debugging.
