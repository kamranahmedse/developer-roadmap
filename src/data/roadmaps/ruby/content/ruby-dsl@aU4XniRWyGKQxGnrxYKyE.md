# Ruby DSLs

A Domain Specific Language (DSL) is a programming language designed for a particular kind of application. Instead of being a general-purpose language that can solve a wide range of problems, a DSL is focused on solving problems in a specific domain, making code more readable and maintainable within that domain. Ruby's flexible syntax makes it well-suited for creating internal DSLs, which are DSLs implemented within Ruby itself, leveraging Ruby's features to create a more expressive and concise syntax for a specific task.
