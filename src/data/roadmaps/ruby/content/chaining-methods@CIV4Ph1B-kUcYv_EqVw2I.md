# Chaining Methods

Chaining methods in Ruby lets you call multiple methods on an object in a single line of code. This works because most methods in Ruby return an object (often `self`, the object the method was called on). By returning an object, the next method in the chain can be immediately called on the result of the previous method. This creates a fluent and readable way to perform a series of operations on a single object.
