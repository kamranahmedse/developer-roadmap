# Logical Operators

Logical operators are symbols or keywords used to combine or modify boolean expressions (true or false). They allow you to create more complex conditions in your code. Common logical operators include AND, OR, and NOT, which are used to determine the overall truthiness of a combined expression based on the truthiness of its individual parts.
