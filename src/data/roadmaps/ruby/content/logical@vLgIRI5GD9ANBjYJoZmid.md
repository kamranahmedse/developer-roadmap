# Logical Operators in Ruby

Logical operators in Ruby let you combine or modify boolean expressions (true or false). The main ones are `&&` (and), `||` (or), and `!` (not). `&&` returns true only if both operands are true. `||` returns true if at least one operand is true. `!` reverses the boolean value of its operand, turning true into false and vice versa. These operators are fundamental for controlling program flow based on different conditions.
