# Monkey Patching

Monkey patching is a technique that allows you to add, modify, or replace existing code in a class or module at runtime. This means you can change the behavior of classes and modules, even those defined in external libraries, without directly altering their source code. It's a powerful tool for extending functionality or fixing bugs, but it should be used with caution as it can lead to unexpected side effects and make code harder to maintain.
