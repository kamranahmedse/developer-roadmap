# Fibers

Fibers are a lightweight way to achieve concurrency. They are essentially blocks of code that can be paused and resumed, allowing you to switch between different execution contexts within a single thread. This enables cooperative multitasking, where the programmer explicitly controls when to switch between different parts of the program.
