# do/while Loops

`do/while` loops are a type of control flow statement that executes a block of code at least once, and then repeatedly executes the block as long as a specified condition is true. The condition is checked *after* the code block is executed, ensuring the block runs at least one time regardless of the initial state of the condition. This is different from a `while` loop, where the condition is checked *before* the code block is executed.
