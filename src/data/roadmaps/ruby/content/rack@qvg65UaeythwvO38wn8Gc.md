# Rack

Rack provides a minimal interface between web servers and Ruby frameworks. By abstracting the connection between the server and the application, Rack allows developers to write Ruby web applications that can run on a variety of web servers with minimal configuration. It essentially provides a common API for handling HTTP requests and responses.
