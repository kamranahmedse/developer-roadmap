# Searching and Filtering in Enumerable

`Enumerable` comes with some methods that allow you to select specific elements from a collection based on certain criteria. This allows you to extract subsets of data that meet your desired conditions, making it easier to work with large datasets or focus on relevant information. Common operations include finding the first element that satisfies a condition, selecting all elements that match a pattern, or rejecting elements that don't meet specific requirements.
