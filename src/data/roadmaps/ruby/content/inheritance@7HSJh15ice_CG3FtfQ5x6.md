# Inheritance

Inheritance in Ruby allows a class (the subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (the superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes an "is-a" relationship. The subclass automatically gains the methods and attributes of the superclass, and can also add its own or override existing ones to customize its behavior.
