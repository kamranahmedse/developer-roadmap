# Naming Conventions

Naming conventions are a set of rules or guidelines for choosing names for variables, methods, classes, and other entities in a programming language. These conventions promote code readability, maintainability, and consistency across a project. Following a standard naming scheme helps developers understand the purpose and scope of different elements within the code, making it easier to collaborate and debug.
