# RSpec

RSpec is a testing tool for Ruby. It provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing tests in a clear and readable format. RSpec focuses on behavior-driven development (BDD), allowing developers to describe the expected behavior of their code in a way that is easy to understand and maintain.
