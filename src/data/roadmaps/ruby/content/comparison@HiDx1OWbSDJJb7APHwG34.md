# Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are symbols used to compare two values. These operators evaluate to either `true` or `false` based on the relationship between the values being compared. Common comparison operators include equal to (`==`), not equal to (`!=`), greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), greater than or equal to (`>=`), and less than or equal to (`<=`).
