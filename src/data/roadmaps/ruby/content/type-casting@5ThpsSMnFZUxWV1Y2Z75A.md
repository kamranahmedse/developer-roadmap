# Type Casting

Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of changing a value from one data type to another. This is often necessary when you need to perform operations that require specific data types or when you want to represent data in a different format. For example, you might need to convert a string representation of a number into an actual integer or float to perform mathematical calculations.
