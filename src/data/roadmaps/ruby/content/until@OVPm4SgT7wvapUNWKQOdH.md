# Until Loop

The `until` loop in Ruby executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is false. It repeatedly runs the code within the loop until the condition becomes true. Think of it as the opposite of a `while` loop; where `while` loops continue as long as the condition is true, `until` loops continue as long as the condition is false.
