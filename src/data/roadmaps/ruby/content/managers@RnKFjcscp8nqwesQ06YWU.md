# Ruby Version Managers

Ruby version managers are tools that allow you to install and manage multiple versions of Ruby on the same system. This is useful because different projects may require different Ruby versions, and using a version manager prevents conflicts and simplifies switching between them. They typically work by modifying your shell environment to point to the desired Ruby installation.
