# Break Statement in Ruby

The `break` statement in Ruby is a control flow tool used to exit a loop prematurely. When `break` is encountered within a loop (like `for`, `while`, `until`, or `each`), the loop's execution is immediately terminated, and the program continues with the next statement after the loop. It's useful for stopping a loop when a specific condition is met, preventing unnecessary iterations.
