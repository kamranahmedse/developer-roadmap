# Package Managers

Package managers simplify the process of installing and managing software, including Ruby, on your system. Instead of manually downloading and configuring Ruby, you can use a package manager specific to your operating system. For example, on macOS, you might use Homebrew, while on Debian/Ubuntu Linux, you'd use apt. These tools handle dependencies and ensure Ruby is installed correctly, making the setup process much easier.
