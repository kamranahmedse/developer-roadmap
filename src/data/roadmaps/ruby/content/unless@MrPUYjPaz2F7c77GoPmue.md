# Unless

`unless` is a conditional statement in Ruby that executes a block of code only if a specified condition is false. It's essentially the opposite of `if`. If the condition provided to `unless` evaluates to false, the code block is executed; otherwise, the code block is skipped. It provides a more readable way to express negative conditions.
