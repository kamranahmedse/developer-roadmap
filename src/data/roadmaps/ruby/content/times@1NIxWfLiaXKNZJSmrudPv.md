# Times Loop

The `times` method in Ruby is a simple way to execute a block of code a specified number of times. It's called on an integer, and the block is executed that many times, with an optional block variable representing the current iteration number (starting from zero). It provides a concise way to repeat actions without needing to explicitly manage a counter variable.
