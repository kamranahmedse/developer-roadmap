# Regular Expressions in Ruby

Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In Ruby, you can use regex to search, replace, or validate text within strings. They are defined using forward slashes (`/pattern/`) or the `%r{pattern}` syntax and provide a powerful way to manipulate and analyze text data based on specific patterns.
