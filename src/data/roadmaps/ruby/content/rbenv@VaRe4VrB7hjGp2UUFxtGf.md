# Rbenv

Rbenv is a command-line tool that allows you to easily manage multiple Ruby environments (versions) on a single system. It works by intercepting Ruby commands and determining which Ruby version to use based on the current directory or a global setting. This enables you to work on different projects that require different Ruby versions without conflicts.
