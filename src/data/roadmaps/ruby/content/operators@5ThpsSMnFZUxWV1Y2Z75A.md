# Operators

Operators are special symbols in Ruby that perform operations on one or more operands (values or variables). These operations can include arithmetic calculations (like addition and subtraction), comparisons (like checking if two values are equal), logical evaluations (like determining if a condition is true or false), and assignment of values to variables. They are fundamental building blocks for creating expressions and controlling the flow of logic in Ruby programs.
