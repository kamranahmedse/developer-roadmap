# Metaprogramming

Metaprogramming is essentially writing code that manipulates other code. It allows you to define methods, classes, or even modify existing ones at runtime. This means your program can dynamically adapt and change its behavior based on conditions or data it encounters while running, rather than being fixed at compile time.
