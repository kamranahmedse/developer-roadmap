# Ruby Hashes

Hashes are collections of key-value pairs. Think of them like dictionaries, where each word (the key) has a definition (the value). Keys are unique within a hash, and they are used to quickly access their corresponding values. Hashes can store any type of data as keys and values, making them a versatile way to organize and retrieve information.
