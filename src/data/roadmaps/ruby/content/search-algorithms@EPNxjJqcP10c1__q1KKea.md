# Search Algorithms

Search algorithms are methods used to find a specific element within a collection of data, like an array or a hash. These algorithms work by systematically checking each element in the data structure until the desired element is found or it's determined that the element is not present. Common examples include linear search, which checks each element sequentially, and binary search, which efficiently finds elements in sorted data by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
