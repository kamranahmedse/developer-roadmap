# Defining Classes

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will possess. Defining a class involves specifying its name and the characteristics that its instances will have. This includes declaring instance variables to hold data and defining methods to perform actions on that data.
