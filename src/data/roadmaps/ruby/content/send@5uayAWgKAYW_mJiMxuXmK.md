# Send

`send` in Ruby is a method that allows you to call other methods on an object dynamically by their name, which is passed as a symbol or string. It essentially bypasses the usual method call syntax, enabling you to invoke methods at runtime based on conditions or data. This provides a powerful way to write flexible and adaptable code.
