# Instance Variables

Instance variables in Ruby are variables that hold data specific to an object. They are defined within a class but belong to individual instances (objects) of that class. You create an instance variable by prefixing a variable name with an `@` symbol (e.g., `@name`). Each object of the class will have its own copy of these variables, allowing you to store different values for each object's attributes.
