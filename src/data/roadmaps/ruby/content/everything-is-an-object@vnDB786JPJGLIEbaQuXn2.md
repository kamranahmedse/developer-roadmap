# Everything is an Object

In Ruby, everything you encounter – numbers, strings, arrays, even classes and methods – is treated as an object. This means that each of these entities is an instance of a class and possesses both state (data) and behavior (methods) that can be invoked. This unified object model is a fundamental characteristic of Ruby's design.
