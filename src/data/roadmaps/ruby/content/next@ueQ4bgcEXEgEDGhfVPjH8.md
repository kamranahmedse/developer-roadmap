# Next Keyword in Loops

The `next` keyword in Ruby provides a way to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. When `next` is encountered within a loop (like `for`, `while`, `until`, or iterators like `each`), the remaining code in the current loop cycle is bypassed, and the loop immediately begins its next cycle, if one exists. This is useful for skipping certain elements or conditions within a collection or range.
