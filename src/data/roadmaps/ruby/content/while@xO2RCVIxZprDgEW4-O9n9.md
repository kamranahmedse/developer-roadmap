# While Loops in Ruby

A `while` loop in Ruby repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It checks the condition before each iteration, and if the condition is false from the start, the code block is never executed. This makes it suitable for situations where you want to execute code an unknown number of times until a certain condition is met.
