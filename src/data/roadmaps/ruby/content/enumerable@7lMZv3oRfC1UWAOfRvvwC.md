# Enumerable

Enumerable is a module in Ruby that provides a collection of useful iteration methods. It's designed to be mixed into classes that represent collections of data, such as arrays and hashes. By including Enumerable, a class gains the ability to iterate over its elements and perform operations like searching, filtering, sorting, and transforming data in a concise and readable way.
