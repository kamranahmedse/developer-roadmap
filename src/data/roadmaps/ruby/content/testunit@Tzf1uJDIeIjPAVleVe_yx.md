# Test::Unit

Test::Unit is a testing framework for Ruby, providing a structure for writing and running tests. It allows developers to define test cases as methods within classes, making it easy to organize and execute tests to verify the correctness of their code. Test::Unit includes assertions to check expected outcomes and report failures, helping ensure code quality and reliability.
