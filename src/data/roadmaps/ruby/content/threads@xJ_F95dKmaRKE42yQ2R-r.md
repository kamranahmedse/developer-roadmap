# Threads

Threads allow you to run multiple blocks of code seemingly at the same time within a single program. Think of them as lightweight processes that share the same memory space. This means they can access the same variables and objects, making it easier to share data, but also requiring careful management to avoid conflicts when multiple threads try to modify the same data simultaneously.
