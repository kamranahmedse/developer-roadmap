# YARD

YARD (Yet Another Ruby Documentation) is a documentation generation tool for the Ruby programming language. It allows developers to create comprehensive and consistent documentation for their Ruby projects by parsing source code and extracting information based on specially formatted comments. YARD generates output in various formats, including HTML, making it easy to browse and share project documentation.
