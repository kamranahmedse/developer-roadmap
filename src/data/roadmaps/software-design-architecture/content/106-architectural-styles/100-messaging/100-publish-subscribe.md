# Publish Subscribe

The publish-subscribe pattern is a messaging pattern in which a publisher sends a message to a topic, and any number of subscribers can subscribe to that topic to receive the message. The publish-subscribe pattern is also known as the "observer pattern" and is a way of implementing communication between different parts of an application in a decoupled way.

The main advantage of using the publish-subscribe pattern is that it allows for a clear separation of concerns between the publisher and the subscribers, and it can improve the flexibility and scalability of the system. Additionally, it allows for loose coupling between components, meaning that the publisher and subscribers are not aware of each other's existence, and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
