# Design Principles

Design principles are fundamental guidelines that help software engineers create systems that are maintainable, scalable, robust, and easy to understand. They represent best practices derived from decades of software engineering experience and are widely used to guide the structure and behavior of code. Applying these principles can lead to better software architecture, easier debugging, and improved collaboration. Some common design principles include:

* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** A component or class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
* **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
* **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
* **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
* **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplication by abstracting repeated logic or code into a single source of truth.
* **Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS):** Simpler designs are preferred over more complex ones unless complexity is necessary.
* **You Aren’t Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Don’t implement something until it’s actually needed.
* **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** Different parts of a software system should be distinct and modularized based on their functionality.
* **Law of Demeter (LoD):** A module should only talk to its immediate friends and not to strangers (i.e., minimal knowledge principle).
* **High Cohesion and Low Coupling:** Modules should do one thing well (high cohesion) and have minimal dependencies on others (low coupling).
