# Design Principles

Design principles are fundamental guidelines that help software engineers create systems that are maintainable, scalable, robust, and easy to understand. They represent best practices derived from decades of software engineering experience and are widely used to guide the structure and behavior of code. Applying these principles can lead to better software architecture, easier debugging, and improved collaboration.
