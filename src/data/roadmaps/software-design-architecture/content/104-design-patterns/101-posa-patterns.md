# POSA Patterns

POSA (Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture) is a set of design patterns for developing software systems that can scale and adapt to changing requirements. These patterns were first described in the book "Patterns of Scalable, Reliable Services" by Kevin Hoffman.

POSA patterns are divided into four categories:

- Partitioning Patterns
- Placement Patterns
- Routing Patterns
- Federation Patterns
