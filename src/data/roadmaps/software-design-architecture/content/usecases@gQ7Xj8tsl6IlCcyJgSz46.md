# Use Cases

Use Cases are a pattern used in enterprise application development to represent the functional requirements of a system. They describe the interactions between the system and its users, and the steps that are required to accomplish a specific goal. Use cases are a way to capture the requirements of the system in a way that is easily understood by both the development team and the stakeholders.

A use case is a description of a sequence of actions that a system performs in response to a request from a user, in order to achieve a specific goal. A use case typically includes:

- The actor (user) who initiates the action
- The goal that the actor wants to achieve
- The steps required to achieve the goal, including any alternative paths or error conditions
- The expected outcome of the interaction

Use cases are often used to drive the design and development of the system, as they provide a clear and detailed understanding of the requirements.
