# Architectural Styles

Architectural styles in software refer to the overall design and organization of a software system, and the principles and patterns that are used to guide the design. These styles provide a general framework for the design of a system, and can be used to ensure that the system is well-structured, maintainable, and scalable.

Some common architectural styles in software include:

- Microservices: where the system is built as a collection of small, independent, and loosely-coupled services.
- Event-Driven: where the system reacts to specific events that occur, rather than being continuously polled for changes.
- Layered: where the system is divided into a set of layers, each of which has a specific responsibility and communicates with the other layers through well-defined interfaces.
- Service-Oriented: where the system is built as a collection of services that can be accessed over a network.
- Data-Centric: where the system is focused on the storage, retrieval and manipulation of data, rather than the processing of data.
- Component-Based: where the system is composed of reusable and independent software components.
- Domain-Driven: where the system is organized around the core business domain and business entities.
