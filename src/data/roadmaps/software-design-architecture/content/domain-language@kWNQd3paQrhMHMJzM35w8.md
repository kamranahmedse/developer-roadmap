# Domain Language

A domain language is a specific vocabulary and set of concepts used to describe and communicate about a specific area of knowledge or business. In software development, a domain language is used to model the objects and concepts within a specific domain, and to capture the relationships and constraints between them.

A domain language is used to provide a common understanding of the problem domain among all stakeholders, including developers, business analysts, and domain experts. It is also used to ensure that the software system accurately reflects the real-world problem it is intended to solve.
