# ORMs

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping, it is a technique used in enterprise application development to map between the object-oriented programming model and the relational database model. It allows developers to work with objects in their code, while the ORM tool takes care of translating those objects into the appropriate database operations.

ORMs are designed to abstract away the complexity of working with a relational database and allow developers to interact with the database using a higher-level, object-oriented API. They provide a set of libraries and tools that map the objects in the code to the tables and rows in the database, and vice versa. This allows developers to work with the data using a familiar object-oriented paradigm, rather than having to write complex SQL queries.
