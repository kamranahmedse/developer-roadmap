# Minimize Cyclomatic Complexity

Cyclomatic complexity is a measure of the structural complexity of a program, which is determined by the number of linearly independent paths through a program's control flow. High cyclomatic complexity can make a program difficult to understand, test, and maintain, so it's often desirable to minimize it in system architecture.

Here are some ways to minimize cyclomatic complexity in system architecture:

- Break down complex functions into smaller, simpler functions that perform specific tasks.
- Use control structures, such as if-else statements and loops, in a consistent and predictable way.
- Use functional programming concepts and techniques, such as immutability and pure functions, to reduce the need for complex control flow.
- Use design patterns, such as the state pattern, to simplify complex control flow.
- Regularly review the code and refactor it to simplify the control flow.
- Use static code analysis tools that can detect and report high cyclomatic complexity in the code.

By following these best practices, the system architecture will be more maintainable, testable, and less error-prone.
