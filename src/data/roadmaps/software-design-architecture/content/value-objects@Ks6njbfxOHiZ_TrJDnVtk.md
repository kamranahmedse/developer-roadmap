# Value Objects

Value Objects are a pattern used in enterprise application development to represent simple, immutable values that are used to model domain concepts. They are typically used to encapsulate data that is not an entity, but is important to the domain.

A Value Object is defined by its value rather than its identity, meaning that two Value Objects with the same value are considered to be equal, regardless of their identity.
