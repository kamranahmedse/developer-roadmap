# Domain Models

A domain model is a representation of a specific area of knowledge or business that is used to model the objects and concepts within that domain, and to capture the relationships and constraints between them. In object-oriented programming (OOP), a domain model is typically represented by a set of classes and interfaces, with each class or interface representing a specific concept or object within the domain.

A domain model is used to provide a clear and consistent representation of the problem domain, and to capture the business requirements and constraints of the system. It is also used to guide the design of the system and to ensure that the system accurately reflects the real-world problem it is intended to solve.
