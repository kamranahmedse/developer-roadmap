# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the practice of wrapping an object's internal data and behavior within a defined interface, and hiding the implementation details from the outside world. It is one of the fundamental concepts of OOP and is closely related to the concepts of data hiding and information hiding.

Encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers (such as "public," "private," and "protected") to control the visibility and accessibility of an object's data and methods. For example, data members of a class can be declared as private, which means they can only be accessed by methods within the class, while methods can be declared as public, which means they can be called by any code that has a reference to the object.
