# Event Driven

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern in which the system reacts to specific events that occur, rather than being continuously polled for changes. In EDA, events are messages that are sent asynchronously between components, and the components react to the events they are interested in.

The main advantage of using EDA is that it allows for a clear separation of concerns between the components, and it can improve the scalability and fault-tolerance of the system. Additionally, it allows for loose coupling between components, meaning that the components are not aware of each other's existence, and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
