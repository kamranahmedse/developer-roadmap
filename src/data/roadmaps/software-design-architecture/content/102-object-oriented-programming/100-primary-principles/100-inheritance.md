# Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class. The class that is inherited from is called the parent or super class, while the class that inherits is called the child or sub class. Inheritance enables code reuse and allows for a hierarchical organization of classes, where a child class can inherit the properties and methods of its parent class and potentially add or override them. The main advantage of inheritance is that it allows for a clean and organized way to reuse code and share functionality among classes.
