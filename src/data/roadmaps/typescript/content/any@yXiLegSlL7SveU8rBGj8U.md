# Any

TypeScript has a special type, `any`, that you can use whenever you don’t want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.

When a value is of type `any`, you can access any properties of it (which will in turn be of type `any`), call it like a function, assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else that’s syntactically legal:

```typescript
let obj: any = { x: 0 };
// None of the following lines of code will throw compiler errors.
// Using `any` disables all further type checking, and it is assumed
// you know the environment better than TypeScript.
obj.foo();
obj();
obj.bar = 100;
obj = 'hello';
const n: number = obj;
```
