# Ecosystem

The TypeScript ecosystem includes many tools and frameworks that make development easier and faster.

## What is an Ecosystem?

An ecosystem is a collection of tools, libraries, and frameworks that work together. Think of it as a toolkit—you don't need all of them, but knowing what's available helps you choose the right ones for your project.

## Why Explore the TypeScript Ecosystem?

- **Speed up development** - Use pre-built tools instead of writing everything from scratch
- **Better code quality** - Tools handle linting, formatting, and testing for you
- **Solve common problems** - Libraries let you focus on your app's unique features

## Main Categories

The TypeScript ecosystem includes tools for:

- **Building & bundling** - Package your code for production (webpack, Vite, Esbuild)
- **Testing** - Make sure your code works correctly (Jest, Vitest)
- **Linting & formatting** - Keep your code clean and consistent (ESLint, Prettier)
- **Data validation** - Check that data is correct before using it (Zod)
- **Server runtime** - Run TypeScript on servers (Node.js with ts-node)
- **Web frameworks** - Build web applications faster (Next.js, Astro, SvelteKit)
