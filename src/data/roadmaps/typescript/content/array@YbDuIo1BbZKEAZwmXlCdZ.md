# Array

To specify the type of an array like `[1, 2, 3]`, you can use the syntax `number[]`; this syntax works for any type (e.g. `string[]` is an array of strings, and so on). You may also see this written as `Array<number>`, which means the same thing.

```typescript
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
```
