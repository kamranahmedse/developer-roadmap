# TypeScript vs JavaScript

TypeScript builds on top of JavaScript and adds optional type information and extra features like interfaces, classes, and namespaces. JavaScript is a flexible language that works without types and is used for both web pages and servers.

Here are a few key differences between TypeScript and JavaScript:

- **Types**: TypeScript lets you add types to your variables and functions, while JavaScript doesn't require this. Adding types helps catch mistakes before your code runs.
- **Features**: TypeScript includes helpful tools like interfaces, classes, and namespaces that make it easier to organize large projects. JavaScript has basic versions of these features.
- **Editor Help**: TypeScript works better with code editors. You get better suggestions, error checking, and refactoring tools built in.
- **Compatibility**: TypeScript works with existing JavaScript code, so you can use TypeScript anywhere JavaScript runs.
