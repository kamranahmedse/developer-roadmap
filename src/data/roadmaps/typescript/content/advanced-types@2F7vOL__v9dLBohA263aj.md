# Advanced Types

Advanced types are powerful TypeScript features that let you create more specific, flexible, and safer types. Think of them as tools to describe exactly what kind of data your code works with.

## Why Learn Advanced Types?

As your code grows, you'll need ways to describe complex data patterns. Advanced types help you:
- **Catch bugs earlier**: TypeScript can catch mistakes before they happen
- **Write flexible code**: Create functions that work with many different types
- **Make code clearer**: Other developers understand what your code expects

## Common Advanced Types

Here are the key advanced types you'll use:

- **Union Types** - "This can be either type A or type B"
- **Intersection Types** - "This must have properties from both type A and type B"
- **Type Aliases** - Give a name to a type you use often
- **Conditional Types** - "Pick type A or B based on a condition"
- **Mapped Types** - Transform one type into another type
- **Literal Types** - "This value must be exactly 'hello' or 42"
- **Type Guards** - Check and narrow types at runtime
- **Index Types** - Work with object properties dynamically
- **Template Literal Types** - Create types using string patterns

## How They Work Together

These types can combine to handle nearly any data pattern you encounter. Start with simpler types, then explore advanced ones as you need them.
