# Error Handling in API Design

Error Handling is a crucial aspect of API design that ensures the stability, usability, and reliability of the API in production. APIs are designed to help systems communicate with each other. However, there can be instances where these systems might encounter exceptions or errors. The process of predicting, catching, and managing these error occurrences is what we refer to as 'Error Handling'. In the context of API Design, it involves defining and implementing specific strategies to detect, manage and inform consumers of any exception or error that occurs while executing requests. Configuring this appropriately provides a more robust and seamless communication experience, enabling developers to debug and rectify issues more efficiently.
