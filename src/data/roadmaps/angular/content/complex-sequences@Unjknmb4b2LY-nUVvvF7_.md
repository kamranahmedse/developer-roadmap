# Complex Sequences

Angular lets you animate coordinated sequences, such as an entire grid or list of elements as they enter and leave a page. You can choose to run multiple animations in parallel, or run discrete animations sequentially, one following another.

The functions that control complex animation sequences are:

- `query()`: Finds one or more inner HTML elements.
- `stagger()`: Applies a cascading delay to animations for multiple elements.
- `group()`: Runs multiple animation steps in parallel.
- `sequence()`: Runs animation steps one after another.
