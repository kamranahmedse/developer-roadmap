# Typed Forms

Since Angular 14, reactive forms are strictly typed by default. You don't have to define extra custom types or add a ton of type annotations to your form declarations to benefit from this extra type safety, as Angular will infer types from the default value of a form control. Non-typed forms are still supported. To use them, you must import the `Untyped` symbols from `@angular/forms`.
