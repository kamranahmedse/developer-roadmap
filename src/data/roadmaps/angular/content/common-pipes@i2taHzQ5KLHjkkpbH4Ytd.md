# Common Pipes

Angular provides built-in pipes for typical data transformations, including transformations for internationalization (i18n), which use locale information to format data. The following are commonly used built-in pipes for data formatting:

- DatePipe: Formats a date value according to locale rules.
- UpperCasePipe: Transforms text to all upper case.
- LowerCasePipe: Transforms text to all lower case.
- CurrencyPipe: Transforms a number to a currency string, formatted according to locale rules.
- DecimalPipe: Transforms a number into a string with a decimal point, formatted according to locale rules.
- PercentPipe: Transforms a number to a percentage string, formatted according to locale rules.
- AsyncPipe: Subscribe and unsubscribe to an asynchronous source such as an observable.
- JsonPipe: Display a component object property to the screen as JSON for debugging.
