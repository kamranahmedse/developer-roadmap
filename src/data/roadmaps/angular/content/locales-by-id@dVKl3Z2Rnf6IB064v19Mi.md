# Locales by ID

Angular uses the Unicode locale identifier (Unicode locale ID) to find the correct locale data for internationalization of text strings. A locale ID specifies the language, country, and an optional code for further variants or subdivisions. A locale ID consists of the language identifier, a hyphen (-) character, and the locale extension. By default, Angular uses `en-US` as the source locale of your project.
