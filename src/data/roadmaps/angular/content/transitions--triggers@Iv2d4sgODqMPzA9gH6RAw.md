# Transitions & Triggers

In Angular, transition states can be defined explicitly through the `state()` function, or using the predefined `*` wildcard and `void` states. An asterisk `*` or wildcard matches any animation state. This is useful for defining transitions that apply regardless of the HTML element's start or end state. Use the `void` state to configure transitions for an element that is entering or leaving a page.
