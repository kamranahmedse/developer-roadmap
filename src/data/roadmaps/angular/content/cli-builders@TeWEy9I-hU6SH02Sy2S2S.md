# CLI Builders

A number of Angular CLI commands run a complex process on your code, such as building, testing, or serving your application. The commands use an internal tool called `Architect` to run CLI builders, which invoke another tool (bundler, test runner, server) to accomplish the desired task. Custom builders can perform an entirely new task or to change which third-party tool is used by an existing command.
