# Inertia

Inertia.js allows you to build single-page applications (SPAs) using server-side routing and controllers. Instead of building an API and a separate frontend, Inertia lets you use your existing server-side framework (like Laravel) for both. It achieves this by rendering server-side views and then using JavaScript to progressively enhance the user experience, creating a seamless SPA feel without the complexity of traditional SPA development.
