# Laravel Cloud

Laravel Cloud provides a streamlined platform for deploying and managing Laravel applications. It simplifies the process of setting up servers, configuring databases, and handling deployments, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure. This typically involves automated provisioning, scaling, and monitoring tools tailored for Laravel applications.
