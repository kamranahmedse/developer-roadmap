# Named Routes

Named routes provide a convenient way to refer to routes throughout your application. Instead of hardcoding route URIs, you can assign a name to a route and then use that name to generate URLs or redirects. This makes your code more maintainable because if the route URI changes, you only need to update it in one place (the route definition) rather than everywhere it's used.
