# Database Configuration

Laravel simplifies database interaction by allowing you to configure database connections within the `.env` file and the `config/database.php` file. The `.env` file stores sensitive information like database credentials, while `config/database.php` defines the available database connections and their default settings. You can specify the database driver (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite), host, port, database name, username, and password. Laravel supports multiple database connections, enabling you to interact with different databases within the same application.
