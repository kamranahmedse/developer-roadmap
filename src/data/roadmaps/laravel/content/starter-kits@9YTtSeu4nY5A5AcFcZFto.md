# Starter Kits

Starter kits provide a pre-built scaffolding for new Laravel applications, offering a foundation with common features like authentication, user interface components, and basic styling already configured. This allows developers to quickly begin building application-specific functionality without having to set up these fundamental elements from scratch. They streamline the initial development process and promote consistency across projects.
