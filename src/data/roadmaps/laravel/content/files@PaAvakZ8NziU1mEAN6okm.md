# File Responses in Laravel

File responses in Laravel provide a way to send files, such as images, PDFs, or documents, directly to the user's browser for download or display. This functionality allows you to serve files stored on your server's filesystem to users, enabling features like downloading reports, displaying images, or providing access to other file-based resources. Laravel offers convenient methods to handle the necessary headers and file streaming for efficient and secure file delivery.
