# Configuration in Laravel

Configuration files in Laravel allow you to manage settings for your application in a centralized and organized manner. These files store key-value pairs that define various aspects of your application's behavior, such as database connections, mail settings, and application-specific parameters. By using configuration files, you can easily modify your application's settings without directly altering the code, making it more flexible and maintainable across different environments.
