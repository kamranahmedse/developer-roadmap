# Task Scheduling

Task scheduling involves automating the execution of specific commands or tasks at predefined intervals. This allows developers to automate repetitive processes, such as sending emails, cleaning up data, or generating reports, without manual intervention. By defining a schedule, these tasks can run in the background, freeing up resources and ensuring timely execution.
