# Error Messages in Validation

Error messages in validation are the feedback provided to users when the data they submit doesn't meet the defined validation rules. These messages inform users about the specific issues with their input, guiding them to correct the errors and successfully submit the form or data. They are crucial for a good user experience, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
