# Middleware

Middleware provides a convenient mechanism for filtering HTTP requests entering your application. Think of it as a series of checkpoints that a request must pass through before reaching your application's core logic. These checkpoints can perform various tasks, such as authenticating users, verifying input data, or even modifying the request before it's handled by your controllers.
