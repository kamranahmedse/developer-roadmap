# HTTP Exceptions

HTTP Exceptions are a specific type of exception used to represent HTTP error responses. They allow you to easily return standard HTTP error codes (like 404 Not Found or 500 Internal Server Error) along with a corresponding message and optional headers directly from your application logic. This provides a clean and consistent way to handle errors and communicate them to the client.
