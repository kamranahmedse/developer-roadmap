# Components in Laravel

Components are reusable pieces of code that encapsulate HTML, CSS, and logic to create modular and maintainable user interface elements. They allow developers to define custom HTML tags that can be used throughout their application's views, promoting code reuse and consistency. This approach simplifies the process of building complex UIs by breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts.
