# Database Directory in Laravel Projects

The `database` directory in a Laravel project houses all files related to your application's database interactions. This includes migrations, which define the structure of your database tables; seeders, which populate your database with initial data; factories, which generate fake data for testing; and any custom database-related logic you might implement. It serves as a central location for managing and version controlling your database schema and initial data.
