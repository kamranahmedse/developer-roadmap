# CRUD Operations in Eloquent ORM

CRUD operations stand for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic functions of persistent storage, and they represent the fundamental operations performed on data within a database. In the context of Eloquent ORM, CRUD operations are simplified through intuitive methods that allow developers to interact with database tables as if they were working with PHP objects.
