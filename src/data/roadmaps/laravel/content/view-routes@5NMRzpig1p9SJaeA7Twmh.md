# View Routes

View routes provide a simple way to return a view directly from a route without needing a full controller. Instead of defining a controller method to load and return a view, you can use the `Route::view` method. This is particularly useful for simple routes that only need to display static content or a basic view without any complex logic. You specify the URI, the view to be rendered, and optionally, an array of data to pass to the view.
