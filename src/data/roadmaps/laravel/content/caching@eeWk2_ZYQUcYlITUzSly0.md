# Route Caching

Route caching in Laravel involves storing the compiled routes in a cache file to significantly reduce the time it takes to register all of your application's routes on each request. Instead of re-parsing route definitions every time, Laravel can quickly load the routes from the cached file, leading to improved application performance, especially in larger applications with many routes. This is particularly beneficial in production environments where route definitions rarely change.
