# OAuth 2.0 API Authentication with Laravel Passport

Passport is a full OAuth 2.0 server implementation for your Laravel application, providing a secure and standardized way to authenticate users and grant access to your API. It allows users to authorize third-party applications to access their data without sharing their credentials, using tokens to represent authorization. This simplifies the process of building APIs that can be consumed by various clients, such as mobile apps or other web applications.
