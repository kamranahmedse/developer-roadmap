# Redirects

Redirects are a way to send a user from one URL to another. They are commonly used after a form submission to prevent resubmitting data, or to guide users to a different part of a website after an action has been completed. A redirect response contains an HTTP status code in the 300 range, indicating that the client should perform another request to a different URL.
