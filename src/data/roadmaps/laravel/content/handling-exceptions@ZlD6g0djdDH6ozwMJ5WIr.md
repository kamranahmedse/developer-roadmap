# Handling Exceptions

Exceptions are unexpected events that disrupt the normal flow of a program's execution. Handling exceptions involves anticipating these potential problems, catching them when they occur, and then gracefully responding to them, preventing the application from crashing and providing informative feedback to the user or logging the error for debugging. This process ensures the application remains stable and user-friendly even when unexpected issues arise.
