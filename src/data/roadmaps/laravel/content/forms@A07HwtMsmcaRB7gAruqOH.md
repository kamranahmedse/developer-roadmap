# Form Validation

Form validation is the process of ensuring that user-submitted data in a form meets specific criteria before it's processed or stored. This involves checking for required fields, verifying data types (like email or number), and ensuring data conforms to specific formats or constraints. Effective validation helps prevent errors, maintain data integrity, and improve the overall user experience by providing immediate feedback on incorrect or missing information.
