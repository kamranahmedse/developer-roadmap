# Sail

Sail is a light-weight command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with Laravel's default Docker development environment. It provides a simple way to manage and run your Laravel application using Docker, without requiring prior Docker experience. It offers commands to start, stop, and manage your application's containers, making local development easier and more consistent.
