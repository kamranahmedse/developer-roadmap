# Views in Laravel

Laravel, beyond processing data and logic, can also present information to the user. One common way to do this is by sending a "view" as a response. A view is essentially an HTML template file that Laravel renders, often populated with data you pass to it from your application's logic. This allows you to dynamically generate web pages and other user interfaces.
