# Route Parameters

Route parameters allow you to capture segments of the URI within your route definitions. These captured segments can then be passed as arguments to your route's controller or closure, enabling you to create dynamic routes that respond to different data. You define parameters by enclosing them in curly braces, such as `{id}`, within the route URI.
