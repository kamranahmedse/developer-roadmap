# Events and Listeners

Events and listeners provide a simple observer pattern implementation, allowing you to subscribe to and react to events that occur in your application. An event signifies that something has happened, while listeners are classes that execute specific actions in response to those events. This decoupling of event triggering and handling promotes cleaner, more maintainable code by allowing different parts of your application to communicate without direct dependencies.
