# Optimization

Optimization, in the context of deployment, refers to the process of refining and improving a deployed application's performance, efficiency, and resource utilization. This involves identifying bottlenecks, reducing resource consumption (like memory and CPU), and enhancing the overall speed and responsiveness of the application to ensure a smooth and scalable user experience in a production environment.
