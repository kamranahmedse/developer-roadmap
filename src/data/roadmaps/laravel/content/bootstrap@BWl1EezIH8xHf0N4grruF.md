# Bootstrap

Bootstrap in a Laravel project is the initial point where the framework starts its execution process. It involves setting up the environment, loading configurations, registering service providers, and handling exceptions. This process ensures that all the necessary components and dependencies are available and properly configured before the application starts processing requests.
