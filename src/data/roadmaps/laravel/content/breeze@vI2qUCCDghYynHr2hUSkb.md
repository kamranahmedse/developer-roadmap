# Breeze

Breeze is a minimal, simple implementation of all of Laravel's authentication features, including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation. It provides a basic starting point for building a new Laravel application with authentication already configured, allowing developers to quickly scaffold the user authentication system and focus on building the core features of their application. Breeze offers Blade templates, Tailwind CSS styling, and can be optionally configured with Inertia.js or Livewire.
