# Vendor Directory

The `vendor` directory in a Laravel project houses all the Composer-installed dependencies. These dependencies are third-party packages and libraries that your project relies on for various functionalities, such as database interactions, authentication, or templating. It's essentially a collection of code that you didn't write yourself but is essential for your application to function correctly.
