# Log Stacks and Messages

Log stacks allow you to send log messages to multiple handlers simultaneously. This provides flexibility in how you manage and store your application's logs, enabling you to route different types of messages to different destinations, such as files, databases, or external services. You can also customize the format and severity level of the messages sent to each handler.
