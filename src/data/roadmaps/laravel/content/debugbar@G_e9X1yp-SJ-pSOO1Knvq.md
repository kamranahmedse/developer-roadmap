# Debugbar

Debugbar is a package that provides a convenient toolbar displayed in the browser, offering insights into your application's performance and debugging information. It allows you to inspect things like queries executed, views rendered, routes matched, and other useful data without having to dig through log files or use `dd()` statements extensively. This makes it easier to identify bottlenecks and understand how your application is behaving during development.
