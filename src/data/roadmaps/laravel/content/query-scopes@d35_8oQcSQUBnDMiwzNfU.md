# Query Scopes

Query scopes in Eloquent provide a way to add constraints to all queries of a given model. They allow you to define common sets of query conditions as reusable methods within your Eloquent models. This promotes cleaner, more maintainable code by encapsulating query logic and preventing duplication across your application.
