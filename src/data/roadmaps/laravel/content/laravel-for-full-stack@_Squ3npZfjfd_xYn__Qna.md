# Laravel for Full Stack

Full-stack development involves building both the front-end (what users see and interact with) and the back-end (the server-side logic, database interactions, and APIs) of a web application. Laravel, primarily a back-end framework, can be effectively used in full-stack development by pairing it with front-end technologies like Vue.js, React, or even Blade templates to create complete web applications. This approach allows developers to leverage Laravel's robust features for handling data, authentication, and routing, while using front-end tools to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
