# App Directory

The `app` directory in a Laravel project houses the core logic of your application. It contains the code that defines your application's behavior, including models, controllers, middleware, services, and other custom classes. This directory is structured to promote organization and maintainability, making it easier to manage and scale your application as it grows.
