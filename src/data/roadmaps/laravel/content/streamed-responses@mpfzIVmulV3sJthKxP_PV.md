# Streamed Responses

Streamed responses allow you to send large files or data streams to the user's browser in chunks, rather than loading the entire content into memory at once. This is particularly useful for handling large downloads, video streaming, or any situation where you need to send data incrementally to avoid memory limitations and improve performance. Instead of waiting for the entire file to be processed, the browser can start receiving and displaying the content as it becomes available.
