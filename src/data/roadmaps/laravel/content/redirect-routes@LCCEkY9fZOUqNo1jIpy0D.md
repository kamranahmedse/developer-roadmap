# Redirect Routes

Redirect routes provide a simple way to create HTTP redirects within your application. Instead of defining a full route with a controller action, you can directly instruct the application to redirect the user to another URL or route. This is useful for creating permanent or temporary redirects, handling old URLs, or simplifying route definitions when only a redirection is needed.
