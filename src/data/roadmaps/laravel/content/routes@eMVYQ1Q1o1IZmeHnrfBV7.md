# Routes

The `routes` directory in Laravel houses all the route definitions for your application. These files tell Laravel how to respond to different HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for specific URLs. Each file typically defines a set of routes, mapping a URL to a specific controller action or closure that will handle the request and return a response.
