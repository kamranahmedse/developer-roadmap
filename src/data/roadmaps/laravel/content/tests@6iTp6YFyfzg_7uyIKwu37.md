# Tests

The `tests` directory in Laravel projects houses all the automated tests for your application. These tests are designed to verify that your code functions as expected, covering various aspects like models, controllers, routes, and features. It typically includes subdirectories like `Feature` for high-level feature tests and `Unit` for testing individual components in isolation. The tests are written using PHPUnit and provide a way to ensure code quality and prevent regressions as your application evolves.
