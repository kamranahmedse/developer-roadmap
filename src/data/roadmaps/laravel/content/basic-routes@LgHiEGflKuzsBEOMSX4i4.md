# Basic Routes

Routing in Laravel determines how your application responds to client requests. It essentially maps URLs (like `/about` or `/contact`) to specific functions or controllers within your application. When a user visits a particular URL, Laravel's router identifies the corresponding route and executes the associated code, which might involve displaying a view, processing data, or performing other actions. This system allows you to define the structure and behavior of your web application based on the URLs users access.
