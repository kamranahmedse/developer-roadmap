# Basic Routes

Basic routes in web applications define how the application responds to client requests, typically HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. They essentially map a specific URL (or URI) to a particular function or action within the application. When a user visits a certain URL, the route directs the request to the appropriate code that will handle it and return a response.
