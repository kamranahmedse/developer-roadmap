# Fluid

Fluid is a template engine for .NET that is based on the Fluid template language, it is similar to Liquid, but it's written in C#. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for parsing and rendering templates, and supports a wide range of features such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. It also provides a wide range of built-in functions for working with strings, numbers, dates, and other types of data. It also supports advanced features such as scripting and metaprogramming. It is often used in web applications to separate the logic of the application from the presentation of the data, making it easy to change the appearance of the application without having to change the underlying code.
