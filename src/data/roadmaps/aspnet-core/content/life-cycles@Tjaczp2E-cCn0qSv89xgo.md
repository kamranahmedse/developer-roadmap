# Life Cycles

In [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET), dependency injection (DI) lifecycles determine the lifetime of objects that are resolved through the DI container. There are several predefined lifecycle options in the `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` library, including:

*   **Transient:** A new instance of the object is created every time it is requested.
*   **Scoped:** A new instance of the object is created for each request within the same scope.
*   **Singleton:** A single instance of the object is created and shared across the entire application.

Additionally, you can also create a custom lifecycle by implementing the `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IServiceScopeFactory` interface
