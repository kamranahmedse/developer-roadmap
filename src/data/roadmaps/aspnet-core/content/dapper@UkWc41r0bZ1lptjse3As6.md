# Dapper

Dapper is a lightweight object-relational mapper (ORM) for the .NET framework. It is designed to provide fast and simple access to data stored in a database, by mapping the data to objects in the application.

Dapper helps you to write efficient and concise code for interacting with databases, without the need for a full-featured ORM like Entity Framework. It provides a set of extension methods for the IDbConnection interface, which you can use to execute SQL queries and map the results to strongly-typed objects.
