# Change Tracker API

The Change Tracker API is a feature of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks, such as Entity Framework Core, that allows developers to track changes to entities and automatically persist them to the database.

The Change Tracker API is typically exposed through the context class, which is the main class that manages the connection to the database and provides access to the entities.
