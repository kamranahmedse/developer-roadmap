# NServiceBus

NServiceBus (NSB) is a service bus framework for building distributed systems using the .NET framework. It provides a set of features for building message-based, loosely-coupled applications, including support for message routing, message handling, and message persistence.

NSB supports multiple messaging transports, including MSMQ, RabbitMQ, and Azure Service Bus, and provides support for advanced messaging patterns such as publish-subscribe, request-response, and message-based sagas.
