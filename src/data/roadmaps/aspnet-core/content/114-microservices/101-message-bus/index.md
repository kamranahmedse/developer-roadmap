# Message Bus

A message bus is a software architecture pattern that enables different parts of an application, or different systems, to communicate with each other asynchronously using a message-based protocol. The message bus acts as a central intermediary, routing messages from senders to receivers and providing features such as message persistence, message routing, and message acknowledgements.

There are different types of message buses, such as event-driven message buses, command-driven message buses, and publish-subscribe message buses. Each type of message bus is designed to handle specific messaging patterns and use cases.
