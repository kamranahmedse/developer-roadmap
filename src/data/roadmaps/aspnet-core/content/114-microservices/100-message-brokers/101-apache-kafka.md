# Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open-source, distributed event streaming platform that is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is designed to handle high volumes of data and to support real-time data processing.

Kafka is based on a publish-subscribe model, where producers write data to topics, and consumers read data from those topics. Data is stored in topics in a log-based format, which allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data.
