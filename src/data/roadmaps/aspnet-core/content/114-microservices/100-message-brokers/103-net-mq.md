# NetMQ

NetMQ is a lightweight, open-source messaging library for building distributed systems and real-time applications in .NET. It provides an API for sending and receiving messages using a variety of messaging patterns and protocols, including request-response, publish-subscribe, and push-pull.

NetMQ is built on top of ZeroMQ, a high-performance, asynchronous messaging library that provides a minimalistic socket-based API for building distributed systems. NetMQ is designed to be easy to use and to abstract away the complexities of ZeroMQ, making it a good choice for developers who want to add messaging capabilities to their ASP.NET applications without having to learn a complex API.
