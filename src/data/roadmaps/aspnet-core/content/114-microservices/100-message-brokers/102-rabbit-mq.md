# RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker software that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). It is written in Erlang and can be used to send and receive messages between different applications in a loosely coupled, asynchronous manner. RabbitMQ supports a variety of messaging patterns, including point-to-point, publish-subscribe, and request-response.

In the context of an ASP.NET application, RabbitMQ can be used to send and receive messages to and from other systems. For example, it can be used to send messages from a web application to a background service, or to send messages between different microservices.
