# GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful and flexible automation platform that enables developers to create custom workflows for their software development lifecycle (SDLC) directly in their GitHub repository. It allows developers to automate various tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying code, directly from their GitHub repository.

In ASP.NET, GitHub Actions can be used to automate various tasks related to the development, testing, and deployment of ASP.NET applications. For example, you can use GitHub Actions to automatically build, test, and deploy an ASP.NET application to a hosting provider, such as Azure or AWS, every time you push code to your GitHub repository.
