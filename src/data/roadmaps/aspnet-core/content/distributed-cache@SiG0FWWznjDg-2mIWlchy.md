# Distributed Cache

A distributed cache is a cache shared by multiple app servers, typically maintained as an external service to the app servers that access it. A distributed cache can improve the performance and scalability of an [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core app, especially when the app is hosted by a cloud service or a server farm.
