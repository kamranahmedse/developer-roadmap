# Triggers

Triggers are special type of stored procedures that are automatically executed in response to specific events that occur within a database. These events can include:

*   Data modification events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on a specific table or view.
*   Data definition events (CREATE, ALTER, DROP) on specific database objects such as tables or views.
*   Logon events (CONNECT, DISCONNECT) that occur when a user connects to or disconnects from the database.
