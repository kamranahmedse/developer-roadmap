# MySQL

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used in web and enterprise applications. It is developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation. MySQL provides a rich set of features to handle high-performance, high-availability, and high-scalability requirements of modern web applications.

In an [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) application, MySQL can be used as the underlying database for storing and retrieving data. There are several libraries available for integrating MySQL with an [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) application, such as MySql.Data, Dapper and EF Core. These libraries provide a .NET client for MySQL, which can be used to interact with the MySQL database from within an [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) application.
