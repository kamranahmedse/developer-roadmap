# MySQL

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used in web and enterprise applications. It is developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation. MySQL provides a rich set of features to handle high-performance, high-availability, and high-scalability requirements of modern web applications.

In an ASP.NET application, MySQL can be used as the underlying database for storing and retrieving data. There are several libraries available for integrating MySQL with an ASP.NET application, such as MySql.Data, Dapper and EF Core. These libraries provide a .NET client for MySQL, which can be used to interact with the MySQL database from within an ASP.NET application.
