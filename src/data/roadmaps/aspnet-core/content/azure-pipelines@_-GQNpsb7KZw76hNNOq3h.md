# Azure Pipelines

Azure Pipelines is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows developers to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. It is a part of the Azure DevOps suite of tools and can be used to automate the software development process for various languages and platforms, including [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET).

In [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET), Azure Pipelines can be used to automate various tasks related to the development, testing, and deployment of [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) applications. For example, you can use Azure Pipelines to automatically build, test, and deploy an [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) application to a hosting provider, such as Azure or AWS, every time you push code to your source control repository.
