# C#

C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is part of the .NET family of languages and is used to build a wide range of applications, from web and mobile applications to games and cloud services.

C# is a statically-typed language, which means that the type of a variable must be specified when it is declared, and that the type of a value cannot be changed after it has been assigned. C# also supports object-oriented programming, which means that it provides features such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

C# is a popular language for building .NET applications, and it is used by many large companies and organizations, including Microsoft, Dell, and IBM. It is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of purposes, and it is well-suited for building scalable and maintainable software systems.
