# AutoMapper

AutoMapper is a library for .NET that allows you to easily map between objects of different types. It is particularly useful when working with domain models and data transfer objects (DTOs) in a layered architecture. It can also be used to map between different versions of an object, or to map between objects in different formats, such as JSON and XML.

AutoMapper uses a convention-based approach to mapping, which means that it automatically maps properties with the same name and type from one object to another. It also provides a fluent API for configuring more complex mappings, such as ignoring certain properties, using custom logic to map properties, or mapping properties based on a value in another property.
