# Object Mapping

Object mapping in ASP.NET refers to the process of converting an object of one type to an object of another type. This can be useful in a number of scenarios, such as when working with domain models and data transfer objects (DTOs) in a layered architecture, or when mapping between different versions of an object or different formats such as JSON and XML.

There are several libraries available for object mapping in ASP.NET, such as AutoMapper, ExpressMapper, AgileMapper, AgileMapster and Mapster. These libraries provide a convenient and flexible way to map between objects, using a convention-based approach or a fluent API to configure more complex mappings. They also support for a wide range of mapping scenarios, including nested and circular object graphs, collections, and different types of inheritance.
