# Unit Testing

Unit testing is a software testing method in which individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. The goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software application is working as intended and that the interactions between units are also working as intended. In the context of ASP.NET, unit testing can be used to test individual components of a web application built using the ASP.NET framework. Unit testing is a good practice in software development as it helps to catch bugs early in the development process, improves the quality of the code and makes it more maintainable. Additionally, unit tests provide developers with a suite of automated tests that can be run against the application at any time. There are different Unit Testing frameworks available for .NET and many libraries for Mocking, Assertions, and fake objects.
