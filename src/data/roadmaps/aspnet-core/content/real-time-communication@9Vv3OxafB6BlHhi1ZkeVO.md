# Real Time Communication

Real-time communication in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) refers to the ability to send and receive data between a client and a server in real-time, typically with low latency. It allows the server to push updates to the client as they happen, instead of the client having to continuously poll the server for updates.

There are several technologies and libraries available for implementing real-time communication in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET), such as WebSockets, SignalR, gRPC, and more.
