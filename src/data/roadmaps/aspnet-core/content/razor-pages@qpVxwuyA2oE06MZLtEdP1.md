# Razor Pages

Razor Pages is a feature of the ASP.NET Core framework that allows developers to build web applications using a combination of Razor markup (a markup syntax for defining dynamic HTML) and C# code. Razor Pages is built on top of the ASP.NET Core MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, and provides a simpler, more intuitive way to build web pages and handle user input.

Razor Pages are useful for building simple, self-contained web pages that do not require a complex navigation or layout structure, and are often used for building small to medium-size web applications.
