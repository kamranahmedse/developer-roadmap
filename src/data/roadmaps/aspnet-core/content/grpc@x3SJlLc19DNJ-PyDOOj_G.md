# gRPC

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework for building remote procedure call (RPC) APIs. It uses the Protocol Buffers data serialization format and the HTTP/2 protocol to create highly efficient and scalable APIs. gRPC supports a variety of programming languages, including C# and ASP.NET.

In ASP.NET, gRPC can be used to create high-performance, low-latency APIs for a variety of use cases. gRPC allows for bi-directional streaming of data, which can be useful for real-time applications such as gaming, financial trading, and more.
