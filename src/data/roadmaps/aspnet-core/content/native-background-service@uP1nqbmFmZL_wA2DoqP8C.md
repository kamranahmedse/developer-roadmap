# Native Background Service

A Native Background Service in ASP.NET is a type of service that can run in the background on a device, without the need for an active user session. These services are typically used for tasks that need to run continuously, such as sending notifications, polling for updates, or processing data.

In ASP.NET, a Native Background Service can be implemented using the IHostedService interface, which is part of the Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting namespace. This interface allows you to create a background service that can run continuously, even when the main application is not running.
