# SignalR Core

SignalR is a real-time communication library for .NET that allows for the creation of real-time web applications. SignalR Core is the latest version of SignalR, which has been rebuilt from the ground up to be cross-platform and lightweight. It allows for bidirectional communication between a client (such as a web page) and a server, enabling real-time updates, notifications, and other interactions. SignalR Core can be used in a variety of scenarios such as chat applications, gaming, and real-time dashboards. It supports multiple transports like WebSockets, Server-Sent Events and Long polling. It also supports for authentication and authorization.
