# Serilog

Serilog is a third-party logging library for ASP.NET Core that allows developers to easily create structured and searchable log data. It is built on top of the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` framework, which is included in ASP.NET Core. Serilog provides features such as automatic logging of request and response data, and the ability to write logs to a variety of destinations, including the console, files, and various logging services. It also supports for filtering and formatting log messages.
