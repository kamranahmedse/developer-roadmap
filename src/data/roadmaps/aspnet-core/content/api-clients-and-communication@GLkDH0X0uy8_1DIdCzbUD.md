# API Clients

API clients in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) are software libraries that allow applications to interact with external APIs. They provide a set of methods and classes that make it easy to send requests to an API and process the responses.

API clients can be used to access a wide variety of services, such as web services, cloud services, and social media platforms. They can be used to perform tasks such as fetching data, posting updates, and deleting resources.

API clients in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) are typically built using the HttpClient class, which is part of the System.Net.Http namespace. This class provides a set of methods for sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses.
