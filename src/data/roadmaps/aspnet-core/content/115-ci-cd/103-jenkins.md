# Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that can be used to automate various tasks related to software development, including building, testing, and deploying code. It is a popular platform that supports a wide range of languages and frameworks, including ASP.NET.

In ASP.NET, Jenkins can be used to automate various tasks related to the development, testing, and deployment of ASP.NET applications. For example, you can use Jenkins to automatically build, test, and deploy an ASP.NET application to a hosting provider, such as Azure or AWS, every time you push code to your source control repository.
