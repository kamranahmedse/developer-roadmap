# Azure Pipelines

Azure Pipelines is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows developers to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. It is a part of the Azure DevOps suite of tools and can be used to automate the software development process for various languages and platforms, including ASP.NET.

In ASP.NET, Azure Pipelines can be used to automate various tasks related to the development, testing, and deployment of ASP.NET applications. For example, you can use Azure Pipelines to automatically build, test, and deploy an ASP.NET application to a hosting provider, such as Azure or AWS, every time you push code to your source control repository.
