# Blazor

Blazor is a framework for building web applications using C# and .NET that runs in the browser via WebAssembly. It allows developers to write C# code that runs directly in the browser, eliminating the need for JavaScript.

Blazor comes in two flavors:

*   Blazor WebAssembly, a client-side solution that allows you to run C# code directly in the browser using WebAssembly. The app is executed on the client-side and can work offline, it can also interact with JavaScript and access the browser's DOM.
*   Blazor Server, a server-side solution that allows you to run C# code on the server and update the UI in real-time. The app is executed on the server-side and requires an active connection to the server to function.
