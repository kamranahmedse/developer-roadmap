# Lazy Eager Explicit Loading

Eager Loading
-------------

Eager Loading helps you to load all your needed entities at once; i.e., all your child entities will be loaded at single database call. This can be achieved, using the Include method, which returns the related entities as a part of the query and a large amount of data is loaded at once.

Lazy Loading
------------

It is the default behavior of an Entity Framework, where a child entity is loaded only when it is accessed for the first time. It simply delays the loading of the related data, until you ask for it.
