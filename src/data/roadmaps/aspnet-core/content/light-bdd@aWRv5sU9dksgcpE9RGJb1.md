# LightBDD

LightBDD is an open-source, lightweight, and easy-to-use BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) framework for .NET, which allows developers to write automated acceptance tests in a simple and readable format. LightBDD is commonly used in the context of [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) and other .NET technologies, to write acceptance tests for web applications. LightBDD is designed to provide a simple, yet powerful, way to write BDD tests. It allows developers to write tests using a fluent API, which allows them to describe the behavior of their application in a natural language format. The framework also provides a set of extension methods, which can be used to add additional functionality, such as validating the output of a test, logging test results, or integrating with other testing tools. LightBDD also comes with a built-in test runner, which makes it easy to execute tests and view the results. The framework supports a variety of test runners, such as NUnit, xUnit, and MSTest, and can be integrated with other BDD frameworks, such as SpecFlow and Cucumber.
