# Nosql

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) is a type of database that does not use the traditional table-based relational model. It is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, and it is often used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can handle high-performance needs and large data sets.

There are several types of NoSQL databases, such as document databases, key-value databases, graph databases, and column-family databases, each with their own unique features and use cases. Some examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, RavenDB, CouchDB, and Redis.
