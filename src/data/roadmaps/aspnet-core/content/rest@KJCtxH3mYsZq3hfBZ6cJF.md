# REST

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services. It is based on the principles of the HTTP protocol, and it uses the conventions of HTTP to create a standard interface for interacting with web services.

In [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET), REST can be used to create web services that expose data in a standardized way. RESTful web services in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) are typically built using the Web API framework, which provides a set of libraries and tools for building RESTful web services.
