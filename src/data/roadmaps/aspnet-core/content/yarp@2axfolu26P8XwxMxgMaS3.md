# YARP

YARP is a library to help create reverse proxy servers that are high-performance, production-ready, and highly customizable. YARP is built on .NET using the infrastructure from [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) and .NET (.NET 6 and newer). The key differentiator for YARP is that it's been designed to be easily customized and tweaked via .NET code to match the specific needs of each deployment scenario. YARP is designed with customizability as a primary scenario rather than requiring you to break out to script or rebuild the library from source.
