# Puppeteer

Puppeteer is an open-source library for automating web browsers, similar to Selenium and Playwright. It's built on top of the Chrome DevTools protocol and it provides a set of APIs that allows developers to interact with web browsers and simulate user interactions, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating between pages. It's commonly used for testing web applications, web scraping, and generating screenshots and PDFs of web pages. Puppeteer for .NET is built on top of the .NET Core runtime and it provides bindings for C# and allows developers to write tests for web applications in C# or other .NET languages.
