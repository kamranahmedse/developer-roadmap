# DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully-managed, NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that can be used to store and retrieve large amounts of data. It is a highly-scalable, fast, and flexible NoSQL database service that supports both document and key-value data models.

DynamoDB is designed to handle extremely high levels of read and write throughput, and it automatically scales to accommodate the traffic of an application. It also provides built-in support for data replication, allowing data to be automatically spread across multiple availability zones for increased durability and availability.
