# Razor

Razor is a markup syntax for embedding server-side code in web pages. It was introduced with [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC 3 and later became a part of [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Pages. It allows developers to write server-side code using C# or Visual Basic and embed it in HTML markup. Its syntax is designed to be compact and easy to read. It provides a rich set of features for building web applications, such as a component model for building reusable UI, a routing system for navigation, and support for dependency injection, it also allows you to use the same libraries, frameworks, and tools that you're already familiar with from building traditional [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) web applications.
