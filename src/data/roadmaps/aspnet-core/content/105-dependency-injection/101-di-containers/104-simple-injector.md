# Simple Injector

Simple Injector is an open-source dependency injection framework for .NET. It is designed to make it easy to manage the dependencies of an application by automatically resolving and managing the lifetime of objects and their dependencies.

Simple Injector uses a technique called "registration" to define the objects and dependencies of an application. This is done by creating an instance of the `Container` class and using its methods to register types, instances and factories. Then, the `GetInstance()` method is called to resolve the dependencies throughout the application.
