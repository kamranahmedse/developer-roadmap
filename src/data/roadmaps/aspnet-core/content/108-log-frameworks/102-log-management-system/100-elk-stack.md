# ELK Stack

The ELK Stack is a collection of three open-source products — Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. ELK stack provides centralized logging in order to identify problems with servers or applications. It allows you to search all the logs in a single place. It also helps to find issues in multiple servers by connecting logs during a specific time frame.

- **E** stands for ElasticSearch: used for storing logs
- **L** stands for LogStash : used for both shipping as well as processing and storing logs
- **K** stands for Kibana: is a visualization tool (a web interface) which is hosted through Nginx or Apache
