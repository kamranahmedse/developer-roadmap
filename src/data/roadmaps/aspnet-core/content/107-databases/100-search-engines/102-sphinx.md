# Sphinx

Sphinx is an open-source full-text search engine that can be used to index, search and analyze large volumes of data quickly and in near real-time. It is designed to handle high-traffic websites and large data sets and can be used for full-text search, faceted search, and geospatial search.

In an ASP.NET application, Sphinx can be integrated as a search engine to provide advanced search functionality to the application. There are several libraries available for integrating Sphinx with an ASP.NET application, such as SphinxQL.NET and SphinxClient. These libraries provide a .NET client for Sphinx, which can be used to interact with the Sphinx engine from within an ASP.NET application.
