# RavenDB

RavenDB is an open-source, NoSQL document database designed for the .NET platform. It is a document database, which means that it stores data in semi-structured JSON format, and it is designed to be simple and easy to use. It is also a multi-model database, which allows you to store and query data using a variety of data models, including document, key-value, graph, and column-family.

In an ASP.NET application, RavenDB can be used as a data store to persist and retrieve application data. There are several libraries available for integrating RavenDB with an ASP.NET application, such as RavenDB.Client, which provides a .NET client for RavenDB that can be used to interact with the RavenDB server from within an ASP.NET application.
