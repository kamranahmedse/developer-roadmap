# MongoDB

MongoDB is a cross-platform, open-source, NoSQL document-oriented database that can be used to store and retrieve large amounts of data. It uses a flexible, JSON-like data structure called BSON (binary JSON) and it is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data.

In an ASP.NET application, MongoDB can be used as a data store to persist and retrieve application data. There are several libraries available for integrating MongoDB with an ASP.NET application, such as MongoDB.Driver and C# MongoDB Driver. These libraries provide a .NET client for MongoDB, which can be used to interact with the MongoDB server from within an ASP.NET application.
