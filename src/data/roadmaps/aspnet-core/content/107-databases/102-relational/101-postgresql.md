# PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL, often simply "Postgres", is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. It was originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley in the 1980s and is now maintained by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group.

Postgres is known for its robustness and reliability, as well as its support for advanced features such as concurrency control, full-text search, and geospatial data. It is also highly extensible, allowing developers to create custom functions and operators in a variety of programming languages, including C, Python, and JavaScript.
