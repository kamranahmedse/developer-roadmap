# ActiveMQ

ActiveMQ is an open-source message broker written in Java that implements the Java Message Service (JMS) API. It can be used to send and receive messages between different applications in a loosely coupled, asynchronous manner. ActiveMQ supports a variety of messaging protocols, including JMS, AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and OpenWire.

In the context of an ASP.NET application, ActiveMQ can be used to send and receive messages to and from other systems. For example, it can be used to send messages from a web application to a background service, or to send messages between different microservices.
