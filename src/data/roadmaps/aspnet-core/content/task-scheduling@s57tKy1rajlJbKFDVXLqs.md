# Task Scheduling

Task scheduling in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) refers to the process of scheduling and executing background tasks in an application. This can include tasks such as sending emails, processing data, generating reports, or performing maintenance tasks.

In [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET), task scheduling can be implemented using a variety of libraries and frameworks such as [Quartz.NET](http://Quartz.NET), Hangfire, Coravel and Microsoft's built-in IHostedService interface. These libraries and frameworks provide a way to schedule tasks to run at specific times or intervals, and also provide APIs for managing and monitoring the progress of scheduled tasks.
