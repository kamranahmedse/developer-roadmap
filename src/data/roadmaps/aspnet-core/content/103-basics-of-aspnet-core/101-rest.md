# REST

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services. In the context of .NET, RESTful web services can be created using the ASP.NET Web API framework, which allows developers to create HTTP-based services that can be consumed by a wide range of clients, including web browsers and mobile devices. The Web API framework provides a set of tools and libraries for creating RESTful services, including routing, request/response handling, and support for a variety of data formats, such as JSON and XML.
