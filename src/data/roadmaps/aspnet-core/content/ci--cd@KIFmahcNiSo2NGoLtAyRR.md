# CI CD

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is a software development practice that involves automating the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. It is a popular practice among software development teams, as it helps to ensure that code changes are integrated, tested, and deployed quickly and reliably.

In the context of [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET), CI/CD can be used to automate various tasks related to the development, testing, and deployment of [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) applications. For example, you can use CI/CD to automatically build, test, and deploy an [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) application to a hosting provider, such as Azure or AWS, every time you push code to your source control repository.
