# CircleCI

CircleCI is a cloud-based continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows developers to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. It is a popular platform that supports a wide range of languages and frameworks, including [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET).

In [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET), CircleCI can be used to automate various tasks related to the development, testing, and deployment of [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) applications. For example, you can use CircleCI to automatically build, test, and deploy an [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) application to a hosting provider, such as Azure or AWS, every time you push code to your source control repository.
