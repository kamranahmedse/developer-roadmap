# Microsoft Extensions Dependency Injection

Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection is a dependency injection framework that is part of the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection NuGet package. It is used to create and manage instances of objects and their dependencies, and is particularly useful for implementing the Dependency Inversion Principle in .NET applications.

The package provides a simple and consistent API for registering services and resolving dependencies, which can be used to configure and manage the lifetime of objects in an application. It also provides built-in support for various types of service lifetime, such as transient, singleton and scoped.
