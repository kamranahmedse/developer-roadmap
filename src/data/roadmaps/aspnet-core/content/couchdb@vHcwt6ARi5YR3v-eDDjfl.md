# CouchDB

CouchDB is an open-source, NoSQL document database designed for the web. It uses a document-oriented data model, which means that it stores data in semi-structured JSON format, and it is designed to be simple and easy to use. CouchDB provides a built-in web interface, called Futon, which can be used to interact with the database, and it also provides an HTTP API that can be used to interact with the database from an ASP.NET application.

In an ASP.NET application, CouchDB can be used as a data store to persist and retrieve application data. There are several libraries available for integrating CouchDB with an ASP.NET application, such as Couchbase, which provides a .NET client for CouchDB that can be used to interact with the CouchDB server from within an ASP.NET application.
