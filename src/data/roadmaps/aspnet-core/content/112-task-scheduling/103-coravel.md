# Coravel

Coravel is an open-source, lightweight library for .NET that allows you to easily perform background processing and scheduling in your ASP.NET Core application. It provides a simple and elegant way to schedule tasks, run background jobs, and manage queues in your application.

Coravel is inspired by Laravel's task scheduler and it's built on top of the .NET Core built-in Dependency Injection. It uses a fluent API to schedule tasks, allowing you to easily specify the frequency, start time, and end time of the task. It also provides a simple way to queue and process background jobs, allowing you to easily process large amounts of data or perform long-running tasks.
