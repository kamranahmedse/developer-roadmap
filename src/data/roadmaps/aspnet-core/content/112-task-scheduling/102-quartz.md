# Quartz

Quartz is an open-source, job scheduling library for .NET that can be used in ASP.NET applications. It is based on the popular Quartz scheduler for Java, and provides a similar feature set for scheduling and executing background jobs in .NET applications.

With Quartz, you can schedule jobs to run at specific times or intervals, and you can also set up triggers to start a job based on certain events. Quartz also provides a rich set of options for configuring and managing your jobs, such as pausing, resuming, and canceling jobs, as well as job chaining and priorities.
