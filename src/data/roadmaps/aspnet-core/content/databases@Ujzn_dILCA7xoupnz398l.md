# Databases

In an ASP.NET application, there are several types of databases that can be used to store and retrieve data. Some of the most commonly used databases include:

- Relational databases
- NoSQL databases
- In-memory databases
- Embedded databases
- Cloud-based databases

Each database type has its own set of features and use cases, and the choice of which database to use will depend on the specific requirements of the application.
