# .NET Framework

.NET (pronounced "dot net") is a software framework developed by Microsoft that can be used to create a wide range of applications, including Windows desktop and web applications, mobile apps, and gaming. The .NET Framework provides a large library of pre-built functionality, including collections, file input/output, and networking, that can be used by .NET applications. It also includes a Common Language Runtime (CLR) which manages the execution of code, providing features such as memory management, security, and exception handling.
