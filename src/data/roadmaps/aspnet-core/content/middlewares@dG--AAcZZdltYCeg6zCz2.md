# Middlewares

Middleware is software that sits between an operating system and application software, and facilitates communication and data exchange between them. In the context of web development, middleware refers to software components that handle requests and responses in a web application. These components are typically executed in a pipeline, with each component performing a specific task, such as authentication, logging, or routing.

In the [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core framework, middleware is a key concept that is used to build web applications. Middleware components are added to the application pipeline using the `IApplicationBuilder` interface, and are executed in the order in which they are added. For example, an application might have middleware components for handling authentication, logging, and routing, in that order.
