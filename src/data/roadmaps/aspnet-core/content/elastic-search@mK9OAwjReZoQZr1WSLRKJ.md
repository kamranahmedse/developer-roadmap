# Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a distributed, open-source search and analytics engine that can be used to index, search, and analyze large volumes of data quickly and in near real-time. It is built on top of the Apache Lucene library and can be used to perform full-text search, faceted search, and geospatial search, among other things.
