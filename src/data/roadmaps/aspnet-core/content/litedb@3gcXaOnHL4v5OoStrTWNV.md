# LiteDB

LiteDB is a lightweight, open-source, NoSQL embedded document-oriented database engine for .NET and .NET Core. It uses a file-based storage system, meaning that the entire database is stored in a single file on disk. It uses a similar syntax to MongoDB, but it is designed to be simple and easy to use, and it does not require a separate server or installation.

LiteDB supports data types like string, int, decimal, DateTime, and also supports binary data and serialized objects. It also supports LINQ, transactions, indexes and collections.
