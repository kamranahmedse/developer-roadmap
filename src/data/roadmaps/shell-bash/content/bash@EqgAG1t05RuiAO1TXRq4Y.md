# Bash

Bash, short for Bourne Again Shell, is a command-line interpreter and a shell scripting language. It's a program that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. Bash interprets these commands and instructs the operating system to perform specific actions, making it a fundamental tool for system administration, automation, and software development.
