# Positional Parameters

Positional parameters in shell scripting are variables that hold the command-line arguments passed to a script. These parameters are represented by special variables like `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, and so on, where each number corresponds to the order in which the argument was provided when the script was executed. `$1` holds the first argument, `$2` the second, and so forth, allowing scripts to access and process input provided by the user.
