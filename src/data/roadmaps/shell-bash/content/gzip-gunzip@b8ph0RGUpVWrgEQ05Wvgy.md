# gzip and gunzip

`gzip` is a command-line utility used to compress files, reducing their size and making them easier to store or transmit. The compressed files typically have a `.gz` extension. `gunzip` is the corresponding command used to decompress files that have been compressed with `gzip`, restoring them to their original state.
