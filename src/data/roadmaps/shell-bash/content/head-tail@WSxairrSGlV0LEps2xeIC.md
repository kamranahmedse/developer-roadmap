# head and tail

`head` and `tail` are command-line utilities used to display the beginning or end of a file, respectively. `head` shows the first few lines of a file, while `tail` shows the last few lines. They are useful for quickly inspecting log files, configuration files, or any text-based data without opening the entire file in a text editor.
