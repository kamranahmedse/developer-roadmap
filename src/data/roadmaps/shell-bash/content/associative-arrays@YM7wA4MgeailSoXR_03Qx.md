# Associative Arrays

Associative arrays, also known as dictionaries or hash maps in other programming languages, are data structures that store key-value pairs. Unlike regular arrays which use numerical indexes to access elements, associative arrays use strings (or other data types in some languages) as keys. This allows you to retrieve values based on meaningful names rather than just positions.
