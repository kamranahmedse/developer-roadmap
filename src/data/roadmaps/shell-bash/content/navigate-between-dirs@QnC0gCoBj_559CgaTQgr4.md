# Navigate Between Directories

Navigating between directories in a shell environment involves moving from one location in the file system to another. This is primarily achieved using the `cd` (change directory) command, which allows users to specify the destination directory, whether it's a relative path from the current location or an absolute path from the root directory. Special notations like `.` (current directory), `..` (parent directory), and `~` (home directory) provide convenient shortcuts for common navigation tasks.
