# set -x

`set -x` is a debugging tool used in shell scripts to trace the execution of commands. When enabled, the shell will print each command to standard error (stderr) before it is executed, preceded by a `+` symbol. This allows you to see exactly what commands are being run and in what order, making it easier to identify errors or unexpected behavior in your scripts.
