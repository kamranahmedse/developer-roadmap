# Pattern Replacement

Pattern replacement in shell scripting involves finding specific patterns within strings and substituting them with other strings. This is a fundamental text processing technique used to modify and transform data, allowing for tasks like cleaning up input, standardizing formats, or extracting relevant information. Shell tools like `sed`, parameter expansion, and `awk` are commonly used to achieve pattern replacement.
