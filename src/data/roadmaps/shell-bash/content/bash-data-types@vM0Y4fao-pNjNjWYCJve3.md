# Bash Data Types

Bash, unlike some other programming languages, doesn't have explicit data types like integers, floats, or strings that you need to declare. Instead, everything is treated as a string. However, Bash can perform arithmetic operations on strings that contain numbers, effectively treating them as numerical values when needed. Arrays are also supported, allowing you to store collections of string values.
