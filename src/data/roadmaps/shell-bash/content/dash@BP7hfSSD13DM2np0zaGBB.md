# dash

dash (Debian Almquist Shell) is a Unix shell that is smaller, faster, and requires fewer resources compared to Bash. It's often used as the default `/bin/sh` on Debian-based systems and is designed to be POSIX-compliant, focusing on speed and efficiency in script execution. This makes it suitable for boot scripts and other system-level tasks where resource usage is critical.
