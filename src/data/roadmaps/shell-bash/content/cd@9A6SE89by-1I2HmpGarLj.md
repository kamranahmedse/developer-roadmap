# cd

`cd` is a fundamental command used to change the current working directory in a shell environment. It allows you to navigate through the file system, moving from one directory to another. By specifying a target directory as an argument, `cd` updates the shell's internal record of the current location, affecting subsequent commands that operate relative to that location.
