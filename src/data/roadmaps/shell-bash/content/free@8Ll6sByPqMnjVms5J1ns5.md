# Free

`free` is a command-line utility used to display the amount of free and used physical and swap memory in a system. It provides a snapshot of the memory usage at a given point in time, showing total memory, used memory, free memory, shared memory, buffer/cache memory, and available memory. This information is crucial for understanding how efficiently a system is utilizing its memory resources and identifying potential memory bottlenecks.
