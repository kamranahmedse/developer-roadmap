# cut and paste

`cut` and `paste` are command-line utilities used for manipulating text files. `cut` extracts specific sections (columns) from each line of a file based on delimiters or character positions. `paste` merges lines from multiple files into a single output stream, typically by concatenating corresponding lines side-by-side.
