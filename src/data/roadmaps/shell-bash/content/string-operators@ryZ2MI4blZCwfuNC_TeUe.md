# String Operators

String operators in Bash are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on strings, such as checking if a string is empty, comparing strings, extracting substrings, or determining the length of a string. These operators are essential for manipulating and evaluating string values within shell scripts, enabling conditional logic and data processing based on string content.
