# fg and bg

`fg` and `bg` are shell commands used to manage processes. `bg` moves a process to the background, allowing you to continue using the terminal while the process runs. `fg` brings a background process to the foreground, giving it control of the terminal. This is useful for managing long-running tasks or temporarily pausing a process.
