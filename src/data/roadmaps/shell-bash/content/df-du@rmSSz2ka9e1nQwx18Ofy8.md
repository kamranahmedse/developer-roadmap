# df and du Commands

`df` (disk free) and `du` (disk usage) are command-line utilities used to monitor disk space on Unix-like operating systems. `df` provides a summary of available and used disk space on mounted file systems, while `du` estimates the file space usage of files and directories. Together, they help system administrators understand how storage is being utilized and identify potential space issues.
