# Direct Execution

Direct execution involves running a shell script by specifying its path directly to the shell. This method requires the script to have execute permissions set. When you directly execute a script, the operating system uses the shebang line (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`) at the beginning of the script to determine which interpreter should be used to execute the script's commands.
