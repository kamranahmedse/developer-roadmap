# Logical Operators in Bash

Logical operators in Bash are used to combine or modify conditional expressions. They allow you to create more complex tests within your scripts, enabling you to execute commands based on multiple conditions being true or false. The primary logical operators are `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT). These operators are essential for controlling the flow of your scripts based on the evaluation of different conditions.
