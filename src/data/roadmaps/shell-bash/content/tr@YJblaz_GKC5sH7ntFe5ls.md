The `tr` command in Unix-like operating systems is a command-line utility that translates or deletes characters. It reads standard input, performs the specified transformations, and writes the result to standard output. `tr` is often used for tasks like converting uppercase to lowercase, deleting specific characters, or replacing one set of characters with another.
