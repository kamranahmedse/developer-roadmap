# rsync

rsync is a command-line utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files between a computer and an external hard drive or across networked computers. It minimizes data transfer by only copying the differences between the source and destination, making it faster than simple copy commands, especially for large files or directories. rsync is commonly used for backups, mirroring data, and updating websites.
