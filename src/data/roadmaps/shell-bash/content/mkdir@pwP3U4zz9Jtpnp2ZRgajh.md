# mkdir

`mkdir` is a command-line utility used to create new directories (folders) in a file system. It allows users to organize files by grouping them into logical structures. The command takes the name(s) of the directory(s) to be created as arguments, and it can also be used to create multiple directories at once or create parent directories if they don't already exist.
