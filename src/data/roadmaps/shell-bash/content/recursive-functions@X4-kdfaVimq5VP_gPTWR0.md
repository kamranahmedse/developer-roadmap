# Recursive Functions

Recursive functions are functions that call themselves within their own definition. This allows a function to repeat a process until a specific condition is met, breaking down a complex problem into smaller, self-similar subproblems. Each call adds a new layer to the execution stack, and it's crucial to have a base case to prevent infinite loops.
