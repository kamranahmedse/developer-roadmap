# Trap

`trap` is a shell command used to specify actions to be taken upon receiving signals. Signals are notifications sent to a process to indicate an event, such as termination, interruption, or an error. The `trap` command allows you to define custom handlers that execute when a specific signal is received, enabling you to gracefully handle errors, clean up resources, or perform other necessary actions before the script exits or continues.
