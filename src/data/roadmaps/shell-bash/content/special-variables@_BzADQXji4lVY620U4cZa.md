# Special Variables

Special variables in shell scripting are predefined variables that automatically hold specific values related to the shell's operation or the script's execution environment. These variables provide access to information like the script's name, the number of arguments passed to it, the exit status of the last command, and process IDs. They are read-only in most cases, meaning you can't directly modify their values, but you can use them to make decisions and control the flow of your scripts.
