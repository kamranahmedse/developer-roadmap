# Package Management

Package management is the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing software packages on a computer system. It provides a standardized way to handle software dependencies, ensuring that all necessary components are present and compatible. Package managers also simplify the process of keeping software up-to-date and removing unwanted applications cleanly.
