# Ping

Ping is a command-line utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It works by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) "echo request" packets to the target host and waiting for ICMP "echo reply" packets. The ping command measures the round-trip time (RTT) for these packets, indicating the latency of the connection, and also reports any packet loss.
