# File Permissions

File permissions in Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux and macOS, control who can access and modify files and directories. These permissions are typically represented by three categories: owner, group, and others. Each category can have read, write, and execute permissions, determining what actions users in that category can perform on the file or directory.
