# Case Conversion

Case conversion involves changing the case of characters within a string. This typically means converting lowercase letters to uppercase, uppercase letters to lowercase, or applying title case (where the first letter of each word is capitalized). It's a common operation for standardizing data, improving readability, or fulfilling specific formatting requirements.
