# File Test Operators

File test operators in Bash are used to check the type and attributes of files. These operators allow you to determine if a file exists, if it's a regular file or a directory, if it's readable, writable, or executable, and other file-related properties. The result of a file test is a boolean value (true or false), which can be used in conditional statements to control the flow of a script.
