# Function Scopes

Function scope determines the visibility and accessibility of variables within a function. In shell scripting, variables can have either global or local scope. Global variables are accessible from anywhere in the script, including within functions, while local variables are only accessible within the function where they are defined. Understanding scope is crucial for avoiding naming conflicts and ensuring that functions operate predictably.
