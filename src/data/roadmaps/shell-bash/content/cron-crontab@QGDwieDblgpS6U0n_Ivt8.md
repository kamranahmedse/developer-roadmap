# cron and crontab

cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. It allows users to schedule tasks (commands or scripts) to run automatically at specific times, dates, or intervals. The crontab (cron table) is a file that contains the schedule of cron jobs for a user. Each user has their own crontab file, and the system also has a system-wide crontab for administrative tasks.
