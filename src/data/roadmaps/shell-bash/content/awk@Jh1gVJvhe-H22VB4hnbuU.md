# awk

`awk` is a powerful text processing tool in Unix-like operating systems. It scans input files line by line, searching for lines that match a specified pattern. When a matching line is found, `awk` performs a specified action on that line, such as printing it, modifying it, or extracting specific fields. It's particularly useful for manipulating data within files and generating reports.
