# Bash Script Anatomy

A Bash script is essentially a plain text file containing a series of commands that the Bash interpreter executes sequentially. It typically starts with a shebang line specifying the interpreter to use, followed by comments explaining the script's purpose, and then the actual commands that perform the desired actions, including variable assignments, control structures (like loops and conditional statements), and function definitions.
