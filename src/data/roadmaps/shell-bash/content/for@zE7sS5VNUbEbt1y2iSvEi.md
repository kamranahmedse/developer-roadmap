# For Loops

A "for" loop is a control flow statement that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code a specific number of times or for each item in a list. It's a fundamental programming construct used to automate repetitive tasks and iterate over collections of data. The loop continues until a specified condition is met, making it a powerful tool for processing data and performing actions multiple times.
