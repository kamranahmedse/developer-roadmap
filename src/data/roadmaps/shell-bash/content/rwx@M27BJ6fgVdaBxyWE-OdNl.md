# rwx File Permissions

In Unix-like operating systems, file permissions control who can access and modify files and directories. The "rwx" notation represents the three fundamental permission types: "r" for read, allowing users to view the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory; "w" for write, allowing users to modify a file or create/delete files within a directory; and "x" for execute, allowing users to run a file as a program or enter a directory. These permissions are assigned to three categories of users: the owner of the file, the group associated with the file, and all other users.
