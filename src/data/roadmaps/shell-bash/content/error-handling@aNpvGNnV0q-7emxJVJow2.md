# Error Handling

Error handling in shell scripting refers to the methods and techniques used to detect, manage, and respond to errors that occur during the execution of a script. It involves checking the exit status of commands, using conditional statements to handle different error scenarios, and implementing mechanisms to gracefully exit or recover from errors, ensuring the script's reliability and preventing unexpected behavior.
