# Basic Regex Syntax

Regular expressions (regex) are sequences of characters that define a search pattern. They are used to match, locate, and manipulate text based on patterns. Basic regex syntax involves using special characters and metacharacters to represent different types of patterns, such as specific characters, character classes, repetitions, and anchors within a string. These patterns are then used by tools like `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` to perform powerful text processing tasks.
