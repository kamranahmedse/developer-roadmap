# SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol that enables secure communication between two computers over an insecure network. It's commonly used for remote command-line access, remote execution of commands, and secure file transfer. SSH encrypts the data transmitted between the client and the server, protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering.
