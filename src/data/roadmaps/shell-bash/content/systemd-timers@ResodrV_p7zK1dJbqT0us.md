# Systemd Timers

Systemd timers are a systemd feature that allows you to schedule tasks to run at specific times or intervals, similar to cron. They provide a more flexible and powerful alternative to cron, offering features like dependency management, event-based activation, and integration with systemd's logging and service management capabilities. Systemd timers are defined using unit files, just like systemd services, and can be used to automate a wide range of system administration tasks.
