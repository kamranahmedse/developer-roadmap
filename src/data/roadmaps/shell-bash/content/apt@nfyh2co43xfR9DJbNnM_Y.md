# apt

`apt` (Advanced Package Tool) is a command-line package management system used primarily on Debian-based Linux distributions like Ubuntu. It simplifies the process of installing, updating, removing, and managing software packages by retrieving them from configured repositories and handling dependencies automatically. `apt` provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the underlying Debian package management system (`dpkg`).
