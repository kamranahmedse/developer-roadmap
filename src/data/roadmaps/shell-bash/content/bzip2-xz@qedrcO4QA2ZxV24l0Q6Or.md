# bzip2 and xz

`bzip2` and `xz` are command-line tools used for file compression in Unix-like operating systems. They reduce the size of files, making them easier to store and transfer. `bzip2` generally offers higher compression than `gzip` but is slower, while `xz` provides even better compression ratios and is often used for distributing software packages, though it can be slower than both `gzip` and `bzip2`.
