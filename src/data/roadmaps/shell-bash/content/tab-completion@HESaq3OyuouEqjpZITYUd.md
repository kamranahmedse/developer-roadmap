# Tab Completion

Tab completion is a feature in command-line interfaces that automatically completes commands, filenames, or other input based on what you've already typed. By pressing the Tab key, the shell attempts to fill in the rest of the word you're typing, saving you time and reducing errors. If multiple possibilities exist, pressing Tab twice usually displays a list of options.
