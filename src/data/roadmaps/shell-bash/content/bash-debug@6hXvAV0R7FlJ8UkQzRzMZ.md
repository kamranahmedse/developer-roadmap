# Bash Debug

The Bash Debug extension for VS Code, powered by `bashdb`, allows you to debug Bash scripts directly within the VS Code editor. It provides features like breakpoints, stepping through code, inspecting variables, and evaluating expressions, making it easier to identify and fix errors in your Bash scripts. This helps streamline the debugging process, offering a more visual and interactive experience compared to traditional methods like using `set -x` or `echo` statements.
