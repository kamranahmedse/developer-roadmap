# Environment vs. Shell Variables

Environment variables are a set of dynamic named values that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer. They are part of the environment in which a process runs. Shell variables, on the other hand, are variables that are specific to the current shell session and are not automatically inherited by child processes. They are used to store temporary values or configure the shell's behavior.
