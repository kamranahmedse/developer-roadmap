Debugging is the process of identifying and removing errors or defects from software code. It involves systematically testing, analyzing, and correcting issues that cause a program to behave unexpectedly or produce incorrect results. Effective debugging relies on using tools and techniques to trace the flow of execution, inspect variable values, and pinpoint the source of the problem.
