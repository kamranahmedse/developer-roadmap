# Asterisk Wildcard

The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that represents zero or more characters. It's used in commands and file paths to match multiple files or directories based on a pattern. For example, `*.txt` will match all files ending with ".txt", and `data*` will match files or directories starting with "data".
