# Uptime

Uptime is a command-line utility that displays how long the system has been running. It provides a concise summary of the current time, how long the system has been up, the number of users currently logged in, and the system's load average over the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes. This information is useful for quickly assessing the system's stability and resource utilization.
