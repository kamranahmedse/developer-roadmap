Variable scope determines the region of a program where a declared variable can be accessed. It defines the visibility and lifetime of a variable. Understanding variable scope is crucial for writing clean, maintainable, and bug-free shell scripts, as it helps prevent naming conflicts and ensures that variables are used in the intended context.
