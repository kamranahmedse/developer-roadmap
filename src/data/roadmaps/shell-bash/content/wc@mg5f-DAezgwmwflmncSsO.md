# wc

`wc` is a command-line utility that displays the number of lines, words, and bytes (or characters) in a file. It's a simple yet powerful tool for quickly getting a summary of the size and content of text files. You can use it to count the number of lines in a log file, the number of words in a document, or the size of a configuration file.
