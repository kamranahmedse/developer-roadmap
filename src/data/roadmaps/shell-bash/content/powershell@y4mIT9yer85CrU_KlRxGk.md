# PowerShell

PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation and configuration management framework, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language. It's built on the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) and accepts and returns .NET objects, which allows for more complex and structured data manipulation compared to traditional text-based shells. PowerShell is designed to be extensible and can be used to manage various systems and applications.
