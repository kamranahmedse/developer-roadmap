# Error Redirection

Error redirection in shell scripting involves capturing and managing error messages generated by commands. By default, standard error (stderr) is displayed on the terminal. Error redirection allows you to redirect these error messages to a file, discard them, or pipe them to another command for further processing, providing better control over script output and debugging.
