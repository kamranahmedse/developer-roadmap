# Expr

`expr` is a command-line utility used to evaluate expressions. It can perform arithmetic operations, string manipulations, and logical comparisons. The `expr` command takes arguments as operands and operators, evaluates the expression, and writes the result to standard output. It's often used in shell scripts for performing calculations and making decisions based on numerical or string values.
