# set -o

The `set -o` command in shell scripting is used to modify shell options, which control the behavior of the shell. These options can affect how the shell interprets commands, handles errors, and performs other tasks. By using `set -o` with specific option names, you can customize the shell's environment to suit your needs, enabling features like error handling, debugging, and more strict command execution.
