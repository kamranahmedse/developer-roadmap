# Conditionals - if

The `if` statement in shell scripting allows you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. It's a fundamental control flow mechanism that enables scripts to make decisions and behave differently depending on the input or state of the system. The `if` statement evaluates an expression, and if the expression is true, a specific set of commands is executed. Otherwise, the script can optionally execute a different set of commands defined in `else` or `elif` blocks.
