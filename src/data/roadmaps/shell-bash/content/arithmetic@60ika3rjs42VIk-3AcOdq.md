# Arithmetic Operators in Bash

Arithmetic operators in Bash are symbols used to perform mathematical calculations within shell scripts. These operators allow you to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder of numbers directly within your scripts, enabling you to perform calculations and manipulate numerical data. Bash primarily uses integer arithmetic, but there are ways to work with floating-point numbers as well.
