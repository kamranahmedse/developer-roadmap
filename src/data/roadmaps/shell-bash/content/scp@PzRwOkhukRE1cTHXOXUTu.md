# scp

`scp`, short for secure copy, is a command-line utility that allows you to securely transfer files between a local host and a remote host or between two remote hosts. It uses the SSH protocol for data transfer, ensuring that the data is encrypted during transmission, thus protecting it from eavesdropping. `scp` is commonly used for tasks like uploading website files to a server, backing up data to a remote location, or sharing files between team members.
