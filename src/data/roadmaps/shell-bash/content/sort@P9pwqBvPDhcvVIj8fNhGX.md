# Sort

`sort` is a command-line utility that arranges lines of text in a specific order. It can sort alphabetically, numerically, by month, or even based on custom criteria. By default, `sort` treats each line as a string and sorts them in ascending ASCII order, but its behavior can be modified using various options to handle different data types and sorting preferences.
