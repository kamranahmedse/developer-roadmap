# nohup

`nohup` is a command-line utility used to run a command immune to hangups, with output redirected to a file. This allows a process to continue running in the background even after the user who started the process logs out or closes the terminal. It's particularly useful for long-running tasks that shouldn't be interrupted by a terminal disconnection.
