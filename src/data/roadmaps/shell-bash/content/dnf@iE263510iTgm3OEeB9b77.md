dnf is a package manager for RPM-based Linux distributions, serving as the successor to YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified). It is used to install, update, and remove software packages, as well as manage dependencies. dnf aims to improve upon YUM by offering better performance, more features, and a more modern architecture.
