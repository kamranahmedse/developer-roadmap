# ps

`ps` is a command-line utility that displays information about active processes running on a Linux or Unix-like operating system. It provides a snapshot of the current processes, including their process IDs (PIDs), resource usage, and other relevant details. This allows users and administrators to monitor system activity and identify processes that may be consuming excessive resources or causing issues.
