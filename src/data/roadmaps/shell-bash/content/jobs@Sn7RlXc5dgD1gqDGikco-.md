# Jobs

In a shell environment, a job represents a process or a group of processes that are running in the background or foreground. The `jobs` command provides a way to list the currently active jobs, check their status (running, stopped, terminated), and manage them, such as bringing them to the foreground or terminating them. It's a crucial tool for controlling and monitoring processes initiated from the shell.
