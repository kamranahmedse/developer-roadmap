# Command Substitution

Command substitution allows you to use the output of a command as an argument to another command. It essentially captures the standard output of a command and inserts it into the command line of another command, enabling you to dynamically generate arguments or values based on the results of other commands. This is useful for tasks like assigning the output of a command to a variable, using the output as input to another command, or constructing complex command lines.
