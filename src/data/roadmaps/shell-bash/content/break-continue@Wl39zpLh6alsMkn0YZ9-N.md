# Break and Continue in Loops

`break` and `continue` are control flow statements used within loops to alter their execution. The `break` statement immediately terminates the loop, transferring control to the next statement after the loop. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration.
