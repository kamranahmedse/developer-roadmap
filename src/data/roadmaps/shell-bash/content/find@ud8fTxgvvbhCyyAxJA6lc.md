# Find

`find` is a command-line utility for searching files and directories within a specified directory hierarchy. It allows you to locate files based on various criteria, such as name, type, size, modification time, permissions, and more. The `find` command recursively traverses the directory structure, applying the specified search criteria to each file and directory it encounters, and then displays the results that match.
