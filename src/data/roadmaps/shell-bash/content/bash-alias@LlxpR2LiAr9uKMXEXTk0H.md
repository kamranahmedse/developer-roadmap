# Bash Alias

A Bash alias is a shortcut or a custom name you assign to a command or a sequence of commands. Instead of typing a long command every time, you can create an alias that represents it. When you type the alias in the terminal, Bash replaces it with the original command before executing it. This simplifies command-line usage and improves efficiency.
