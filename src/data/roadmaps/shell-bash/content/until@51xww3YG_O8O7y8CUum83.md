# Until Loops

An `until` loop in shell scripting repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is false. The loop continues to iterate until the condition becomes true, at which point the loop terminates. It's essentially the opposite of a `while` loop, providing a way to execute commands until a desired state is reached.
