# grep

`grep` is a command-line utility used for searching plain-text data sets for lines matching a regular expression. It outputs the lines that contain the specified pattern, making it a powerful tool for filtering and locating specific information within files or streams of data. Its name comes from the ed command `g/re/p` (globally search a regular expression and print).
