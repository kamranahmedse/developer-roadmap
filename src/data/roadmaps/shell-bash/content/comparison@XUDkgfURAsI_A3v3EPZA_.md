# Comparison Operators in Bash

Comparison operators in Bash are used to compare values, typically numbers or strings. These operators allow you to create conditional statements within your scripts, enabling different code blocks to execute based on whether a comparison is true or false. They are fundamental for making decisions and controlling the flow of execution in your Bash scripts.
