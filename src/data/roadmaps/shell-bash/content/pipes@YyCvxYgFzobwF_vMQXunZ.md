# Pipes

Pipes in shell scripting are a form of redirection that allows you to send the output of one command as the input to another command. This creates a chain of commands where the data flows from one process to the next, enabling you to perform complex data manipulation and filtering concisely and efficiently. The pipe operator, represented by the vertical bar `|`, connects the standard output of the command on the left to the standard input of the command on the right.
