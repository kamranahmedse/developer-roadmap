# While Loops

A `while` loop in shell scripting repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. It's a fundamental control flow statement that allows you to automate repetitive tasks based on a dynamic condition that can change during the loop's execution. The loop continues iterating until the condition becomes false.
