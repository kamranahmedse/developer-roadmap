# stdin, stdout, and stderr

In computing, standard streams are preconnected input and output communication channels between a computer program and its environment. Specifically, *stdin* (standard input) is the channel through which a program receives input, typically from the keyboard or another program. *stdout* (standard output) is the channel through which a program writes its normal output, usually displayed on the screen. *stderr* (standard error) is the channel through which a program writes error messages and diagnostic information, also typically displayed on the screen, but kept separate from *stdout* to allow for easier handling of errors.
