Bash operators are special symbols or characters that perform specific actions or comparisons within a Bash script or command line. They are fundamental building blocks for controlling program flow, manipulating data, and performing various operations like arithmetic calculations, string comparisons, file manipulations, and logical evaluations. Understanding and using these operators effectively is crucial for writing robust and efficient Bash scripts.
