# Numeric Data in Bash

Bash, by default, treats all variables as strings. However, Bash can perform arithmetic operations on variables that contain numeric values. While Bash doesn't have explicit data types like integers or floats in the same way as other programming languages, it interprets strings as numbers when used in arithmetic contexts. This allows you to perform calculations, comparisons, and other numeric manipulations within your shell scripts.
