# tar

`tar` (Tape Archive) is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems used for archiving and extracting files. It combines multiple files into a single archive file, often referred to as a "tarball." While `tar` itself doesn't compress the archive, it's commonly used in conjunction with compression tools like gzip or bzip2 to create compressed archives (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.tar.bz2` files), reducing file size for storage or distribution.
