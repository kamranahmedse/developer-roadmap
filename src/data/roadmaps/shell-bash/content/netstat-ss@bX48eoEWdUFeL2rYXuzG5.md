# netstat and ss

`netstat` and `ss` are command-line tools used to display network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships. They provide insights into the network activity of a system, allowing users to diagnose network issues, monitor connections, and understand network traffic patterns. While `netstat` has been a long-standing tool, `ss` (socket statistics) is a newer utility that offers faster and more detailed information about network sockets.
