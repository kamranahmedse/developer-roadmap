# less and more

`less` and `more` are command-line utilities used to view the contents of text files, one screen at a time. They allow users to navigate through the file, search for specific patterns, and perform other basic text manipulation tasks directly from the terminal. `less` is generally preferred over `more` because it offers more features, including the ability to scroll backwards.
