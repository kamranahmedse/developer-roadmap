Curly braces `{}` are used for multiple matches.  Each string can be an exact name, or a wildcard. It will find anything that matches any of the given strings using an or relationship (one OR the other). For example, `touch file{1,2,3}.txt` will create three files: `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`.
