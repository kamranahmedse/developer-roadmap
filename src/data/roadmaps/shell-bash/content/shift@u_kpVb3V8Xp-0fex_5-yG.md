# Shift

The `shift` command in shell scripting renames the command-line arguments. Specifically, it moves each argument one position to the left. The value of `$2` becomes `$1`, the value of `$3` becomes `$2`, and so on. The original value of `$1` is lost. This is particularly useful when you need to process a variable number of arguments passed to a script.
