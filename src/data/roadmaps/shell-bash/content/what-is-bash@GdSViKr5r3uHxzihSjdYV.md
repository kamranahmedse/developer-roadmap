# What is Bash?

Bash, short for Bourne Again Shell, is a command-line interpreter and a shell scripting language. It's essentially a program that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. Bash interprets these commands and instructs the operating system to perform specific actions, such as running programs, manipulating files, and managing system resources. It also provides features for automating tasks through scripts.
