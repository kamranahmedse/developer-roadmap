# Find

The `find` command is a powerful utility used to locate files and directories within a file system hierarchy. It allows you to search based on various criteria, such as name, size, modification time, permissions, and file type. The `find` command recursively traverses directories, making it suitable for locating files across an entire file system or within specific subdirectories.
