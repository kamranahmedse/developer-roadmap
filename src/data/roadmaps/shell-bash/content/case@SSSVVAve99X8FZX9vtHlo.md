# Case Statements

Case statements provide a way to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable or expression. They offer a structured alternative to multiple `if-elif-else` statements, making code more readable and maintainable when dealing with several possible conditions. Each condition is associated with a specific pattern, and when the variable's value matches a pattern, the corresponding code block is executed.
