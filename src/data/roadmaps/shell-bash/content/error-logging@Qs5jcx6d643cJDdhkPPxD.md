# Error Logging

Error logging is the process of recording errors that occur during the execution of a script or program. This involves capturing information about the error, such as the type of error, the time it occurred, and the location in the code where it happened. Effective error logging facilitates debugging, troubleshooting, and monitoring application health by providing a historical record of issues.
