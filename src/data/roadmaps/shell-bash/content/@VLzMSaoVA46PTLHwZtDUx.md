# Script Arguments using $@

`$@` is a special variable in shell scripting that expands to all the positional parameters (arguments) passed to a script. Each argument is treated as a separate word, even if it contains spaces, ensuring that the script receives and processes each argument individually. This is particularly useful when you need to iterate over or manipulate each argument provided to your script.
