# ksh

ksh, or the Korn shell, is an interactive command language and scripting language. It's designed to be backward-compatible with the Bourne shell (sh) while incorporating many features from other shells like csh. ksh offers improvements in scripting capabilities, command-line editing, and job control, making it a powerful tool for both interactive use and automating tasks.
