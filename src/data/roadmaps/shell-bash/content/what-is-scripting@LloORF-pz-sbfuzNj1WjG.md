# What is Scripting?

Scripting is the process of writing a series of commands that are executed in a specific order by a program or scripting engine. These commands, often written in a simple, human-readable language, automate tasks, control software applications, or interact with operating systems. Instead of manually entering commands one by one, a script allows you to run a sequence of instructions with a single command.
