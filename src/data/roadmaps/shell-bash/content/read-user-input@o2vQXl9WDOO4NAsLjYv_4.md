# Read User Input

Reading user input in a shell script allows the script to interact with the person running it. This is achieved by pausing the script's execution and waiting for the user to type something and press Enter. The entered text can then be stored in a variable and used later in the script for various purposes, such as making decisions or providing customized output.
