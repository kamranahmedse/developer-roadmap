# Conditionals

Conditionals in shell scripting allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. This enables your scripts to make decisions and respond dynamically to different situations, making them more versatile and powerful. Common conditional statements include `if`, `elif` (else if), and `else`, which are used to control the flow of execution based on the evaluation of expressions.
