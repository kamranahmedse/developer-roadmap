# Here Strings

Here strings provide a way to pass strings to commands as standard input. They are a simplified form of here documents, designed for single-line input. Instead of redirecting a file or typing input directly, you can embed the string directly within the command using the `<<<` operator. This is particularly useful for commands that expect input from stdin but you want to provide it inline within your script.
