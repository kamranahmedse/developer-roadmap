# Redirects & Pipelines

Redirects and pipelines are fundamental features in the shell that allow you to control the flow of data between commands. Redirects change where a command's input comes from or where its output goes, allowing you to read from files or write to files. Pipelines connect the output of one command directly to the input of another, enabling you to chain commands together to perform complex operations in a sequence.
