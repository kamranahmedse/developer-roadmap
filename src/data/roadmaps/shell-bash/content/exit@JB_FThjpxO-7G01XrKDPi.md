# Exit Codes

Exit codes are numerical values returned by a program or script upon completion. These codes signal whether the execution was successful or if any errors occurred. By convention, an exit code of 0 typically indicates success, while any non-zero value signifies a failure or specific error condition. These codes are crucial for scripting and automation, allowing scripts to make decisions based on the outcome of previously executed commands.
