# Running with Bash

Running a shell script with Bash involves explicitly invoking the Bash interpreter to execute the commands within the script. This is typically done by using the `bash` command followed by the script's filename as an argument. This method ensures that the script is interpreted and executed using the Bash shell, regardless of the script's shebang line or the user's default shell.
