# bc

`bc` is a command-line utility for arbitrary-precision arithmetic. It allows you to perform calculations with numbers of any size and with a specified level of decimal precision, making it suitable for tasks where standard shell arithmetic is insufficient. `bc` can be used interactively or non-interactively, reading expressions from standard input or from files.
