# Bash -n

The `bash -n` option is a debugging tool that allows you to perform a syntax check on your Bash script without actually executing it. This is useful for identifying errors like typos, missing keywords, or incorrect syntax before running the script and potentially causing unintended consequences. It essentially parses the script and reports any syntax errors it finds.
