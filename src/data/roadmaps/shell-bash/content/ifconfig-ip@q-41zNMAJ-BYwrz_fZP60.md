# ifconfig and ip Commands

`ifconfig` and `ip` are command-line utilities used to configure and manage network interfaces on Unix-like operating systems. They allow you to view, configure, and control network interfaces, including assigning IP addresses, setting network masks, and enabling or disabling interfaces. While `ifconfig` is an older tool, `ip` is the modern replacement offering more features and flexibility.
