# Output Redirection

Output redirection in shell scripting allows you to control where the output of a command is sent. Instead of displaying on the terminal, you can redirect it to a file, either overwriting the file or appending to it. This is achieved using special operators like `>`, `>>`, `2>`, and `&>`. These operators provide a way to manage standard output (stdout), standard error (stderr), and both, making it easier to process and store command results.
