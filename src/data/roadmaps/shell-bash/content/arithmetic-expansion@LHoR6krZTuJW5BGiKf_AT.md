# Arithmetic Expansion

Arithmetic expansion allows you to perform mathematical calculations directly within your shell scripts. It uses the `$((...))` syntax to evaluate expressions, treating the contents inside the parentheses as an arithmetic expression. This enables you to perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo, and assign the results to variables or use them in conditional statements.
