# printf Formatting

`printf` is a command-line utility used to format and print text in a specific way. It allows you to control the appearance of output by using format specifiers, which define how different types of data (strings, numbers, etc.) should be displayed. This includes specifying the width, precision, alignment, and other attributes of the output.
