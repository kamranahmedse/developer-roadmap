# Handling Conflicts

When multiple developers work on the same project simultaneously, conflicts can arise during the merging process. This occurs when changes made by different individuals overlap or contradict each other in a specific code file. In such situations, Git's conflict resolution mechanism comes into play, allowing users to manually resolve these issues and merge the conflicting changes.
