# PR from a Fork

Creating a pull request from a fork on GitHub is a common workflow for contributing to open-source projects or collaborating on repositories you don't have direct write access to. After forking the original repository to your GitHub account, you can make changes in your fork, commit them, and then create a pull request to propose these changes to the original repository. This process allows project maintainers to review your contributions, discuss any necessary modifications, and ultimately merge your changes into the main project if they're approved. It's an essential feature that facilitates collaboration and code review in distributed development environments.
