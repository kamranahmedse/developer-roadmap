# Git LFS

Git Large File Storage (LFS) is an extension that helps manage large files by tracking metadata, not storing entire files. It allows storing and tracking binary assets like images, videos, audio files separately from your regular Git repository. By storing only metadata in your Git repository, you improve clone and push times, reducing storage usage. This approach is particularly useful for media repositories, large dataset storage, and binary asset management in game development. Note that Git LFS requires a separate server or storage system to store actual file content.
