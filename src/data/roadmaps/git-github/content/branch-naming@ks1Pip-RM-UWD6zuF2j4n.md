# Branch Naming

A well-defined branch naming convention is essential for maintaining a clean and organized Git workflow. It's recommended to use descriptive and meaningful names that clearly indicate the purpose of each branch. For example, using prefixes like `feature/`, `fix/`, or `docs/` can help identify whether a branch is related to new feature development, bug fixes, or documentation updates. Additionally, including the issue or task ID (e.g., `issue/123`) can provide context and make it easier for team members to find relevant information. By following a consistent naming convention, you can improve collaboration, reduce confusion, and increase the overall efficiency of your Git workflow.
