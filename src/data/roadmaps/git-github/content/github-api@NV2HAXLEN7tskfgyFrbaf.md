# GitHub API

The GitHub API is a powerful tool that allows developers to interact with the GitHub platform programmatically. It provides access to various GitHub features, such as user data, repository information, and commit history, through both REST and GraphQL interfaces. The API supports authentication, implements rate limiting, and offers webhooks for real-time notifications, enabling developers to automate tasks, create custom integrations, and build applications that leverage GitHub's functionality.
