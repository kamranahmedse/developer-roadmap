# Kanban Boards

On GitHub, Kanban boards provide a visual representation of issues as they move through the development process.

A Kanban board typically has columns representing different stages or states, such as "To-Do", "In-Progress", and "Done". Each issue is represented by a card on the board, which can be moved between columns as its state changes. Users can drag and drop issue cards to move them from one column to another, reflecting progress or completion.
