# GitHub Releases

GitHub Releases is a feature that allows developers to package and distribute software versions to users. It provides a way to create tagged points in a repository's history, attach binary files (such as compiled executables or packaged code), and include release notes. This feature makes it easy to track and manage different versions of a project, share pre-compiled binaries with users who may not want to build from source, and communicate changes and updates to the community. GitHub Releases integrates seamlessly with Git tags and can be automated as part of a continuous integration and deployment pipeline.
