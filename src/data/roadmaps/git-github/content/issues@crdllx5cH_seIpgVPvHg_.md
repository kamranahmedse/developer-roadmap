# Issues

On GitHub, an issue is a way to track and report bugs, feature requests, or other problems with a repository. Here are some key aspects of issues:

- Creating issues: Users can create new issues by submitting a form on the repository's Issues page.
- Issue titles and descriptions: Each issue has a title and body (description), which provide context for the problem or request.
- Assignees: Issues can be assigned to specific users, who are then responsible for addressing the issue.
- Labels: Labels are used to categorize issues by topic, priority, or other criteria. This helps filter and organize issues within a repository.
- States: Issues have states that reflect their status, such as "Open", "Closed", or "Pending".
- Comments: Users can comment on existing issues to discuss or provide additional context.
- Labels and milestones: Issues can be associated with labels (topics) and milestones (deadlines), which help filter and prioritize them.

Issues are a core feature of GitHub repositories, enabling teams to collaborate effectively on resolving problems and implementing new features.
