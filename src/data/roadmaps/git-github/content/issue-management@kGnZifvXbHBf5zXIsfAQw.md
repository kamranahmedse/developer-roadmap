# Issue Management

The GitHub CLI provides a range of features for managing issues within your repository. Here are some key actions you can perform:

- Listing issues: Run `gh issue list` to view a list of all open and closed issues.
- Creating issues: Use `gh issue create --title "Issue Title" --body "Issue body"` to create a new issue with the specified title and body.
- Assigning issues: Run `gh issue assign <issue-number> <username>` to assign an issue to a specific user.
- Labelling issues: Use `gh issue label <issue-number> <label-name>` to add a label to an existing issue.
- Closing issues: Run `gh issue close <issue-number>` to mark an issue as closed.
