# Installation and Setup

The GitHub CLI can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. Installation options include downloading binaries directly from the release page or using package managers (such as homebrew, pip, etc).

Once installed, setting up the GitHub CLI typically involves authenticating with your GitHub account by running `gh auth login` in your terminal. This step is essential for linking your GitHub credentials to the CLI, allowing you to interact with your repositories and perform various actions.
