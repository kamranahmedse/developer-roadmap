# Static Site Generators

GitHub offers a set of static site generators (SSGs) that allow users to create and deploy websites directly from their GitHub repositories. These SSGs include `Jekyll`, `Hugo`, and `Middleman`, among others. They provide a simple way to build websites without the need for manual configuration or maintenance.
