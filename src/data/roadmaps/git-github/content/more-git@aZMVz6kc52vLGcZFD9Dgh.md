# More Git

Git offers several advanced features to manage complex scenarios, including hard resets with `git reset`, reverting changes with `git revert`, reordering commits with `git rebase`, merging in new changes with `git merge`, squashing commits into a single change, temporarily saving uncommitted changes with `git stash` and then applying them with `git stash apply`, and selectively picking specific commits from one branch to apply on another with `git cherry-pick`.
