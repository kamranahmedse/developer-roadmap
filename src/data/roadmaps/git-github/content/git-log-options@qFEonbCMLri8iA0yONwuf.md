# git log options

`git log` is a command in Git that shows the commit history of your repository. It provides a detailed view of all commits, including their hashes, authors, dates, and messages.

Here are some common git log options:

- `-2`: Only show the last two commits.
- `--all`: Show all branches in the repository.
- `--graph`: Display the commit history as a graph.
- `--pretty`: Enable clean colorized output.
- `--no-color`: Disable colorized output.
- `--stat`: Show a statistical summary of changes.
- `**-S`: Only show commits with modified files.

You can combine these options to tailor your log output to suit your needs.

For example, `git log -2 --graph` will display the last two commits in graph form.
