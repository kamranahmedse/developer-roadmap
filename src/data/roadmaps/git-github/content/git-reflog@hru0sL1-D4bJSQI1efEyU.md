# Git Reflog

Git reflog is a powerful tool in Git that keeps a record of all the changes made to the branches and commits in your repository, including actions that are not part of the regular commit history, such as resetting branches or checking out commits. It's particularly useful for recovering lost commits or understanding the history of changes in your repository, even if those changes are not reflected in the normal commit history.Reflog stands for "reference log." It records when the tip of branches or other references (like HEAD) is updated in your repository.
