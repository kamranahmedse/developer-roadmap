# Mentions

Mentions on GitHub allow you to notify specific users or teams about comments, issues, pull requests, or other activities. This feature improves collaboration by encouraging participation and discussion among team members, increasing visibility of important topics, and streamlining communication within your repository. To use mentions, simply type `@username` or `@teamname` in a comment, and GitHub will auto-complete the mention as you type, automatically linking their username to the comment and notifying them about the discussion.
