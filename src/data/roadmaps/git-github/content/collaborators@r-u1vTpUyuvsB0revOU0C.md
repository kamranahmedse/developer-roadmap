# Collaborators

Collaborators in GitHub are users who have been granted direct access to a repository by the repository owner or organization administrators. Collaborators can perform actions like pushing commits, creating branches, and managing issues or pull requests, depending on the permissions granted to them. They are typically added to private repositories or to public repositories where more control over contributions is needed.
