# Markdown

Markdown is a simple way to add formatting to text without using HTML tags or other complex syntax. It's easy to read and write, making it suitable for documentation, README files, and more. Some basic GitHub Markdown features include:

- Basic syntax: Use headers (`# Heading`), bold/italic text (**bold**, *italic*), and lists (- item) to format text.
- Links: Create links with `[text](url)` or `[text][ref]`.
- Images: Embed images with `[![alt-text](image-url)]`.

By using Markdown, you can easily format text within your GitHub repository, making it easier to read and understand for yourself and others.
