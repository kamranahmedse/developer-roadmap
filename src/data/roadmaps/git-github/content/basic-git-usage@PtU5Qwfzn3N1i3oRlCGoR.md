# Basic Git Usage

Starting with a new project, you'll use `git init` to initialize a repository and then make changes using `git add`. Once ready, commit your work with `git commit`. If mistakes occur, `git reset` can help correct them. You'll also interact with remote repositories, whether private or public, by adding remotes (git remote add) and managing their connections through commands like `git fetch`, `git push`, and `git pull`.
