# GitHub CLI

GitHub CLI is a command-line interface tool that brings GitHub functionality to your terminal. It allows developers to interact with GitHub directly from the command line, enabling them to manage repositories, create issues, pull requests, and perform various GitHub operations without leaving their terminal environment. This powerful tool streamlines workflows, enhances productivity, and provides a seamless integration between local development and GitHub's collaborative features, making it easier for developers to incorporate GitHub into their daily coding routines.
