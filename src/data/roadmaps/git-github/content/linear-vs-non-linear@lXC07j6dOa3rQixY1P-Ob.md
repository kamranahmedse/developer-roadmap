# Linear vs Non-Linear

In Git, linear and non-linear history refer to different ways of managing commit history.

- Linear history: A repository with a linear history has commits that are applied in a single, sequential order.
- Non-linear history: A repository with a non-linear history allows multiple branches or lines of development, which can be merged back into the main branch at different points.
