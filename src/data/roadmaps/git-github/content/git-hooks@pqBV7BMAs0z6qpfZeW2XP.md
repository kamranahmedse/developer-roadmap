# Git hooks

Git hooks are scripts that run automatically at specific points during the Git workflow, such as when you commit, push, or pull changes from a repository. These scripts can be used to perform various tasks, like validating code, formatting files, or even sending notifications.

There are two types of Git hooks:

- Client-side hooks: Run on your local machine before committing changes.
- Server-side hooks: Run on the remote server when you push changes.
