# Private vs Public

GitHub offers both private and public repositories, each serving different purposes in software development. Public repositories are visible to everyone on the internet, making them ideal for open-source projects, collaboration, and showcasing work to a wider audience. They encourage community contributions and can help developers build their portfolios. Private repositories, on the other hand, are only accessible to the repository owner and designated collaborators. These are suitable for proprietary code, sensitive projects, or work that's not ready for public consumption. Private repositories offer greater control over access and visibility, making them essential for businesses and individuals who need to keep their code confidential.
