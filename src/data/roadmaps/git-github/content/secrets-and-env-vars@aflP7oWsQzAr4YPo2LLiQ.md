# Secrets and Env Vars

GitHub provides features to securely store and manage sensitive data, such as secrets and environment variables.

- Secrets: These are sensitive values that should not be committed to a repository, like API keys or database credentials.
- Environment Variables: They can be used to set values for your workflow or application, making it easier to manage dependencies.
