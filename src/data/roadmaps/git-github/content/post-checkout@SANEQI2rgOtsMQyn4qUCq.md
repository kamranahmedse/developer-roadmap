# post-checkout

Git post-checkout hooks are scripts that run automatically after a successful `git checkout` operation. These hooks provide a way to customize Git's behavior and perform specific actions when switching branches or updating the working directory. Post-checkout hooks can be used for tasks such as updating dependencies, regenerating files, or adjusting project settings based on the newly checked-out branch. They offer developers a powerful tool to automate workflows and maintain consistency across different branches in a Git repository.
