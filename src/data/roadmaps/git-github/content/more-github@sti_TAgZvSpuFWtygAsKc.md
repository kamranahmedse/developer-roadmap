# More GitHub

In addition to Git, GitHub provides several features that enhance collaboration and project management. GitHub Actions allows for automating workflows and testing code within the platform, while the GitHub CLI enables users to interact with GitHub from their local terminal using commands like `gh`. Additionally, GitHub supports Markdown formatting for creating readable documentation and comments, which can be used in repositories and issues.
