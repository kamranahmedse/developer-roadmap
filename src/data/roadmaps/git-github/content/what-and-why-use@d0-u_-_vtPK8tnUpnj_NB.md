# What and Why use?

Git submodules are a feature that allows you to include one Git repository within another. They are useful for managing external dependencies or shared components across projects.

Key points:
1. Separate repositories with independent histories
2. Parent repository tracks specific submodule commits
3. Enables code reuse and modular project structure
4. Helps manage dependencies and keep main repository focused
5. Facilitates collaboration on complex projects

Benefits:
- Including third-party libraries
- Sharing common code
- Managing multi-component projects
- Keeping main repository lightweight

Note: While powerful, submodules can add complexity to your workflow, so careful consideration is needed before implementation.
