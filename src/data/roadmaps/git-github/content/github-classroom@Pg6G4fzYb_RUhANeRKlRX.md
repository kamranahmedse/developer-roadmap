# GitHub Classroom

GitHub Classroom is an integrated feature within GitHub that allows educators to create and assign homework assignments, projects, or quizzes directly to students. This feature streamlines the process of teaching and learning by making it easy for instructors to share code, provide feedback, and track student progress all in one place. By using GitHub Classroom, teachers can focus on high-level instruction and student engagement, while also promoting collaboration and hands-on learning experiences.
