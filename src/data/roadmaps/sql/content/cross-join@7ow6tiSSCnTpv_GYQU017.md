# Cross Join

The cross join in SQL is used to combine every row of the first table with every row of the second table. It's also known as the Cartesian product of the two tables. The most important aspect of performing a cross join is that it does not require any condition to join.

The issue with cross join is it returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, which can result in large numbers of rows and heavy resource usage. It's hence critical to use them wisely and only when necessary.
