# RDBMS Benefits and Limitations

Here are some of the benefits of using an RDBMS:

- **Structured Data**: RDBMS allows data storage in a structured way, using rows and columns in tables. This makes it easy to manipulate the data using SQL (Structured Query Language), ensuring efficient and flexible usage.

- **ACID Properties**: ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties ensure reliable and safe data manipulation in a RDBMS, making it suitable for mission-critical applications.

- **Normalization**: RDBMS supports data normalization, a process that organizes data in a way that reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity.

- **Scalability**: RDBMSs generally provide good scalability options, allowing for the addition of more storage or computational resources as the data and workload grow.

- **Data Integrity**: RDBMS provides mechanisms like constraints, primary keys, and foreign keys to enforce data integrity and consistency, ensuring that the data is accurate and reliable.

- **Security**: RDBMSs offer various security features such as user authentication, access control, and data encryption to protect sensitive data.

Here are some of the limitations of using an RDBMS:

- **Complexity**: Setting up and managing an RDBMS can be complex, especially for large applications. It requires technical knowledge and skills to manage, tune, and optimize the database.

- **Cost**: RDBMSs can be expensive, both in terms of licensing fees and the computational and storage resources they require.

- **Fixed Schema**: RDBMS follows a rigid schema for data organization, which means any changes to the schema can be time-consuming and complicated.

- **Handling of Unstructured Data**: RDBMSs are not suitable for handling unstructured data like multimedia files, social media posts, and sensor data, as their relational structure is optimized for structured data.

- **Horizontal Scalability**: RDBMSs are not as easily horizontally scalable as NoSQL databases. Scaling horizontally, which involves adding more machines to the system, can be challenging in terms of cost and complexity.
