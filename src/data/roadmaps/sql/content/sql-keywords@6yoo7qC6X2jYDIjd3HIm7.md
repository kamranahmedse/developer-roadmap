# SQL keywords

SQL keywords are reserved words that have special meanings within SQL statements. These include commands (like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`), clauses (such as `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`), and other syntax elements that form the structure of SQL queries. Understanding SQL keywords is fundamental to writing correct and effective database queries. Keywords are typically case-insensitive but are often written in uppercase by convention for better readability.
