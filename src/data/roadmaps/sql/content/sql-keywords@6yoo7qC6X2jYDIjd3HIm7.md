# SQL keywords

SQL keywords are reserved words that have special meanings within SQL statements. These include commands (like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE), clauses (such as WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING), and other syntax elements that form the structure of SQL queries. Understanding SQL keywords is fundamental to writing correct and effective database queries. Keywords are typically case-insensitive but are often written in uppercase by convention for better readability.
