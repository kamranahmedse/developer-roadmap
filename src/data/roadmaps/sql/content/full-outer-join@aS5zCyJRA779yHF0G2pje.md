# FULL OUTER JOIN

A `FULL OUTER JOIN` in SQL combines the results of both `LEFT` and `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`s. It returns all rows from both tables, matching records where the join condition is met and including unmatched rows from both tables with `NULL` values in place of missing data. This join type is useful when you need to see all data from both tables, regardless of whether there are matching rows, and is particularly valuable for identifying missing relationships or performing data reconciliation between two tables.
