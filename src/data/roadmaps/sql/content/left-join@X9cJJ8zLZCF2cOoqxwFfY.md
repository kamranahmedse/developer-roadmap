# LEFT JOIN

A `LEFT JOIN` in SQL returns all rows from the left (first) table and the matching rows from the right (second) table. If there's no match in the right table, `NULL` values are returned for those columns. This join type is useful when you want to see all records from one table, regardless of whether they have corresponding entries in another table. `LEFT JOIN`s are commonly used for finding missing relationships, creating reports that include all primary records, or when working with data where not all entries have corresponding matches in related tables.
