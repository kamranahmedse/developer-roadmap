# Table

A table is a fundamental structure for organizing data in a relational database. It consists of rows (records) and columns (fields), representing a collection of related data entries. Tables define the schema of the data, including data types and constraints. They are the primary objects for storing and retrieving data in SQL databases, and understanding table structure is crucial for effective database design and querying.
