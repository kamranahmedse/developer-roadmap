# Primary Key

A primary key in SQL is a unique identifier for each record in a database table. It ensures that each row in the table is uniquely identifiable, meaning no two rows can have the same primary key value. A primary key is composed of one or more columns, and it must contain unique values without any `NULL` entries. The primary key enforces entity integrity by preventing duplicate records and ensuring that each record can be precisely located and referenced, often through foreign key relationships in other tables. Using a primary key is fundamental for establishing relationships between tables and maintaining the integrity of the data model.
