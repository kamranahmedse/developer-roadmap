# Basic SQL Syntax

Basic SQL syntax consists of straightforward commands that allow users to interact with a relational database. The core commands include `SELECT` for querying data, `INSERT INTO` for adding new records, `UPDATE` for modifying existing data, and `DELETE` for removing records. Queries can be filtered using `WHERE`, sorted with `ORDER BY`, and data from multiple tables can be combined using `JOIN`. These commands form the foundation of SQL, enabling efficient data manipulation and retrieval within a database.
