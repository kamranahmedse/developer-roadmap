# Insert

The "INSERT" statement is used to add new rows of data to a table in a database. There are two main forms of the INSERT command: `INSERT INTO` which, if columns are not named, expects a full set of columns, and `INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)` where only named columns will be filled with data.
