# Selective Projection

Selective projection in SQL refers to the practice of choosing only specific columns (attributes) from a table or query result, rather than selecting all available columns. This technique is crucial for optimizing query performance and reducing unnecessary data transfer. By using SELECT with explicitly named columns instead of SELECT *, developers can improve query efficiency and clarity, especially when dealing with large tables or complex joins.
