# Row

In SQL, a row (also called a record or tuple) represents a single, implicitly structured data item in a table. Each row contains a set of related data elements corresponding to the table's columns. Rows are fundamental to the relational database model, allowing for the organized storage and retrieval of information. Operations like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE typically work at the row level.
