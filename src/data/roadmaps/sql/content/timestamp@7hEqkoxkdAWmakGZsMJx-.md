# TIMESTAMP

SQL `TIMESTAMP` is a data type that allows you to store both date and time. It is typically used to track updates and changes made to a record, providing a chronological time of happenings.

Depending on the SQL platform, the format and storage size can slightly vary. For instance, MySQL uses the 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS' format and in PostgreSQL, it's stored as a 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS' format but it additionally can store microseconds.
