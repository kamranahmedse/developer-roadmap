question:
  title: 'What is a Python developer?'
  description: |
    A Python developer is a software developer tasked with building web services, automating tasks, performing data analysis, and everything in between using Python.
    
    In terms of responsibilities, they will vary based on their project, company, and seniority. However, they usually include writing efficient code, managing data structures (especially when doing data science with Python), optimizing algorithms, and working with frameworks such as Pandas, TensorFlow, Django, and others.
    
    ## How to become a Python developer?
    
    To become a Python developer, the first step is learning the basics of Python, including data types, functions, and object-oriented programming (you can get away without learning OOP as well since Python allows for a hybrid programming model). 
    
    Understanding how to work with Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Requests is also essential. Since Python can be used in many different ways, picking the right library and framework to focus on depends on you and your intentions with the language.
    
    Beyond coding skills, to become a great Python developer, you should also spend some time looking into data structures like linked lists, trees, and hash maps. While they're not critical to building applications, they're great tools to show you how to solve problems in different ways.
    
    Python developers should also learn about version control systems like Git, and completing projects that involve APIs, automation, or data processing helps in building a strong portfolio. One way to do this is by contributing to open-source projects to get hands-on experience and improve your problem-solving skills.
    
    ## Is Python a frontend or backend language?
    
    Python is a backend language, as the only language natively supported by browsers is JavaScript. On the backend, it is used to build the server-side logic that handles data processing, authentication, and even database management. 
    
    While it can be used on the frontend through the addition of extra libraries such as [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/), this is not a normal practice as it adds dependencies and extra logic to already complex applications.
    
    In web development, Python is often used alongside Django or Flask to build robust backend services. It is also used for API development, data processing, and automation. 	
    
    ## What is Python used for?
    
    Python is used for many different things and across multiple domains, given how versatile it is. 
    
    In web development, for example, Python can be used with frameworks like Django and Flask to help developers create scalable applications. In data science, it is the de facto language for data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (thanks to libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow).
    
    In the field of automation, this language is also very popular, allowing developers to streamline repetitive tasks through Python code. 
    
    Finally, even though it's not as popular in these industries, Python can be used in cybersecurity, embedded systems, and even game development. Many companies use Python for cloud computing and backend services because of its simplicity and extensive support for integration with external systems.
