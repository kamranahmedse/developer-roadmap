# Tuples

A tuple is an ordered and immutable collection of elements in Python. Unlike lists, tuples cannot be modified after creation, making them useful for storing fixed data such as coordinates, configuration values, or records that should remain unchanged. Tuples support indexing, iteration, and unpacking, and because they are immutable, they can also be used as dictionary keys or returned safely from functions as multiple values.
