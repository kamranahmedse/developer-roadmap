# pipenv

Pipeline Environment (pipenv) is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundled, requirements.txt, [setup.py](https://docs.python.org/3.11/distutils/setupscript.html), setup.cfg, etc.) to the Python world. It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your Pipfile as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever-important Pipfile.lock, which is used to produce deterministic builds.
