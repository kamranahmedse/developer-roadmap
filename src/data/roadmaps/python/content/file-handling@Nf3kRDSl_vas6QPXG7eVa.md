# File Handling in Python

File handling in Python involves reading data from and writing data to files. It allows programs to interact with files stored on a computer's storage. You can open files in different modes like read, write, or append, and then perform operations like reading the entire file content, reading line by line, or writing new data. A common use case is working with structured data, and Python provides built-in modules like `json` to easily read and write data in JSON format, which is frequently used for data exchange.
