# Asynchronous
Asynchronous programming is a type of parallel programming in which a unit of work is allowed to run separately from the primary application thread. When the work is complete, it notifies the main thread about completion or failure of the worker thread.
This style is mostly concerned with the asynchronous execution of tasks. Python has several asynchronous frameworks that are used to implement asynchronous programming.
