# PDM

PDM is a modern Python package manager that supports PEP 582, which allows packages to be installed in a `__pypackages__` directory instead of the traditional `site-packages` directory. It aims to provide a streamlined and improved experience for managing dependencies, building, and publishing Python projects. PDM also includes features like dependency resolution, virtual environment management, and project scaffolding.
