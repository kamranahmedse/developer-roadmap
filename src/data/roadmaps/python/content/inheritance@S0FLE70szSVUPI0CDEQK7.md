# Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming where a new class (the child class or subclass) is derived from an existing class (the parent class or superclass). The child class inherits attributes and methods from the parent class, allowing for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. This promotes a more organized and maintainable codebase by establishing a clear structure and reducing redundancy.
