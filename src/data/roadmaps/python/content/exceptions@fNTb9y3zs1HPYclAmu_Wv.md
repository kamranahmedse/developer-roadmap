# Exceptions

Exceptions are runtime errors that occur during program execution in Python. Instead of immediately stopping the program, Python allows developers to handle these errors using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. Proper exception handling helps manage unexpected situations such as invalid input, missing files, or network failures, improving program reliability and allowing applications to fail gracefully.
