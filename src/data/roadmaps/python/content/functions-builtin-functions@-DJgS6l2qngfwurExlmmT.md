# Functions

In programming, a function is a reusable block of code that executes a certain functionality when it is called. Functions are integral parts of every programming language because they help make your code more modular and reusable.

In Python, you define a function with the `def` keyword, then write the function identifier (name) followed by parentheses and a colon.
