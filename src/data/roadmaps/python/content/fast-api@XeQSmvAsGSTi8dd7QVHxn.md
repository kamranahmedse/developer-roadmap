# FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern Python web framework used for building APIs with high performance and automatic documentation. It leverages Python type hints for request validation, serialization, and editor support, making API development faster and less error-prone. FastAPI is commonly used for backend services, microservices, and machine learning model deployment due to its speed and ease of use.
