# Working with Strings

Strings in Python are sequences of characters used to represent text. You can create them by enclosing characters within single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes. Once created, strings are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed directly. Common operations include accessing individual characters using indexing, slicing to extract substrings, concatenating strings using the `+` operator, and using built-in methods to manipulate and format the text they contain.
