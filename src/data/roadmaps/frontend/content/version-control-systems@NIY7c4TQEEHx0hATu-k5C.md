# Version Control Systems

Version Control Systems (VCS) like Git, Subversion, and Mercurial track code changes, enabling multiple developers to collaborate by maintaining a history of modifications. Git is popular for its distributed model and branching. VCS features include branching for parallel work, merging changes, reverting to past states, remote repositories, pull requests, and code reviews. They also offer backup, recovery, conflict resolution, and tagging. VCS is crucial in modern software development for productivity, code quality, and collaboration.
