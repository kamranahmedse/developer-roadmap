# Angular

Angular is a popular tool from Google for building websites and web apps. It uses TypeScript (a type of JavaScript) to create large, efficient single-page applications (SPAs), where content loads in one go without needing to reload the whole page. Angular builds UIs with reusable components, like building blocks. It has features like two-way data binding (data updates automatically in different places), dependency injection (helps manage code parts), and a strong template system. Angular also offers tools for testing, page navigation, and managing app data, making it great for big, complex projects.
