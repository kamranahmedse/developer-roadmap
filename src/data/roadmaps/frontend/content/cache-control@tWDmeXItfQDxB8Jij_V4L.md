# Cache-Control

Cache-Control is an HTTP header used to specify caching directives in HTTP requests and responses. These directives control how browsers and other intermediaries (like CDNs) should cache content. By setting appropriate Cache-Control headers, developers can influence whether a resource is stored, for how long, and under what conditions, ultimately impacting website loading speed and reducing server load.
