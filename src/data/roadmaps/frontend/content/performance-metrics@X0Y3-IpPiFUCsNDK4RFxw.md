# Performance Metrics

Web performance metrics are quantitative measures of the performance of a web page or application. They are used to assess the speed and efficiency of a web page, and they can help identify areas for improvement. Some common web performance metrics include:

- Load time: The time it takes for a web page to fully load and become interactive.
- First contentful paint (FCP): The time it takes for the first content to appear on the page.
- Time to interactive (TTI): The time it takes for the page to become fully interactive.
- First input delay (FID): The time it takes for the page to respond to the first user input.
- Total blocking time (TBT): The time it takes for the page to become fully interactive, taking into account the time spent blocking the main thread.
