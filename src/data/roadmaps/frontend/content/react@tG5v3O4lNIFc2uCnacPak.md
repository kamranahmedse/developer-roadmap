# React

React is a JavaScript tool from Facebook for building UIs, especially for single-page apps. It lets you create reusable UI parts that update when data changes. React uses a virtual DOM for speed and has a one-way data flow. This component style makes code neat and reusable. React also works with tools like Redux for data management and React Native for mobile apps. It's popular because it's clear, fast, and has a big community.
