# GitLab

GitLab is a web-based DevOps platform that provides a complete solution for the software development lifecycle. GitLab emphasizes an all-in-one approach, integrating various development tools into a single platform. It's available as both a cloud-hosted service and a self-hosted solution, giving organizations flexibility in deployment. GitLab's focus on DevOps practices and its comprehensive feature set make it popular among enterprises and teams seeking a unified platform for their entire development workflow. While similar to GitHub in many respects, GitLab's integrated CI/CD capabilities and self-hosting options are often cited as key differentiators.
