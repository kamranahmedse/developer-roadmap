# Cloudflare

Cloudflare is a service that sits between your website and its visitors, acting as a reverse proxy. It provides a range of features including a content delivery network (CDN) to speed up website loading times by caching content closer to users, DDoS protection to safeguard against malicious attacks, and SSL/TLS encryption to secure data transmission. It essentially helps improve website performance, security, and reliability.
