DevTools are a set of web developer tools built directly into web browsers. They allow you to inspect and debug HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, monitor network activity, analyze performance bottlenecks, and more. By using DevTools, frontend developers can understand how their code is executed in the browser and identify areas for optimization.
