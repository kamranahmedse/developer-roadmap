# Rolldown

Rolldown is a fast JavaScript bundler written in Rust, designed to be a drop-in replacement for Rollup. It takes your JavaScript and related assets (like CSS and images) and packages them into optimized bundles that can be efficiently loaded in a web browser. Rolldown aims to improve build performance and provide a smoother development experience compared to existing JavaScript bundlers.
