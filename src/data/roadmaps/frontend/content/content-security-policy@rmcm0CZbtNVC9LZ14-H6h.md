# Content Security Policy

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security standard implemented by web browsers to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other code injection attacks. It works by allowing web developers to specify which sources of content are trusted and can be loaded on a web page. CSP is typically implemented through HTTP headers or meta tags, defining rules for various types of resources like scripts, stylesheets, images, and fonts. By restricting the origins from which content can be loaded, CSP significantly reduces the risk of malicious code execution. It also provides features like reporting violations to help developers identify and fix potential security issues. While powerful, implementing CSP requires careful configuration to balance security with functionality, especially for sites using third-party resources or inline scripts.
