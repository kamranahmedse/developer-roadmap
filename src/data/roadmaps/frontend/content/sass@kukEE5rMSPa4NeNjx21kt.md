# Sass

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a mature, stable, and powerful professional-grade CSS extension language. It extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass allows for more organized, maintainable, and reusable styles in complex projects. It compiles to clean, standard CSS, supporting two syntaxes: the original indented syntax and the more popular SCSS (Sassy CSS) syntax. Sass provides functionality like control directives for libraries, making it easier to write well-structured, scalable CSS. Its features help reduce repetition in CSS and save time, making it a popular choice among frontend developers for managing large, complex stylesheets.
