# Service Workers

Service Workers are a type of web worker that acts as a proxy between a web page and the network, allowing web developers to build offline-first and reliable applications. Service Workers can intercept network requests, access the cache, and make decisions on how to respond to a request based on the available resources. Service Workers are written in JavaScript and are registered by a web page. Once registered, they can control the page and all its requests, even when the page is not open in a browser. This allows Service Workers to enable features such as push notifications, background synchronization, and offline support. Service Workers are supported by most modern web browsers, and they are an essential component of progressive web applications (PWAs).
