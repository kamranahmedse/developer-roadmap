# SolidJS

SolidJS is a JavaScript tool for building website interfaces that is known for being very fast and efficient. It updates only the parts of the page that change, which makes it perform well. SolidJS doesn't use a virtual DOM; instead, it directly changes the real DOM. Its syntax is like React, so many developers find it familiar. It supports JSX, has built-in ways to manage data, and is small in size. SolidJS is getting popular for its speed, simplicity, and smart way of handling updates.
