# Git

Git is a tool for tracking code changes in software projects. It lets many developers work together by keeping a history of all changes. Git is great for branching (working on different features at once) and merging (combining changes). Everyone has a full copy of the project, so they can work offline. Git is fast, flexible, and the most popular version control system, especially for open-source projects.
