# How Does The Internet Work

The Internet works through a global network of interconnected computers and servers, communicating via standardized protocols. Data is broken into packets and routed through various network nodes using the Internet Protocol (IP). These packets travel across different physical infrastructures, including fiber optic cables, satellites, and wireless networks. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ensures reliable delivery and reassembly of packets at their destination. Domain Name System (DNS) servers translate human-readable website names into IP addresses. When you access a website, your device sends a request to the appropriate server, which responds with the requested data. This process, facilitated by routers, switches, and other networking equipment, enables the seamless exchange of information across vast distances, forming the backbone of our digital communications.
