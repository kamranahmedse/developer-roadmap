# Web APIs

Web APIs are interfaces provided by web browsers that allow JavaScript code to interact with the browser environment and the wider web. These APIs provide access to functionalities like manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), handling user input, making network requests, managing browser history, and accessing device hardware like the camera or microphone. They essentially bridge the gap between JavaScript and the capabilities of the browser and the underlying operating system.
