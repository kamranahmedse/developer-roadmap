# Location API

The Geolocation API is a web API that provides access to the device's location data, such as latitude and longitude. It allows web developers to build location-based applications, such as mapping and location sharing, by using the device's GPS, Wi-Fi, and other sensors to determine the user's location. To use the Geolocation API, a web page must first request permission from the user to access their location. If permission is granted, the page can then use the `navigator.geolocation` object to access the device's location data. The API provides several methods for getting the user's current location, watching for location changes, and calculating distances between two locations.
