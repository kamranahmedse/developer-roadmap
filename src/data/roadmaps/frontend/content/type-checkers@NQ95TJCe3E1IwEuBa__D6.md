# Type Checkers

Type checkers are tools that analyze code to verify that the types of values used in a program are consistent with their declared or inferred types. They help catch type-related errors during development, before the code is run, by identifying mismatches between expected and actual data types. This process ensures that operations are performed on compatible data, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and improving code reliability.
