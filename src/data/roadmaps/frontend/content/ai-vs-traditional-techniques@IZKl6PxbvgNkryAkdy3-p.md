# AI vs. Traditional Software Development

Traditional software development relies on developers explicitly writing code to instruct computers on how to perform tasks. This involves defining every step and logic manually. AI-assisted coding, however, leverages machine learning models trained on vast amounts of code to automate parts of the development process. Instead of writing all the code from scratch, developers can use AI to generate code snippets, suggest improvements, and even debug errors, potentially leading to faster development cycles and reduced human error.
