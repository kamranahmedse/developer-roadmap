# JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is a core technology of the World Wide Web. It allows for dynamic, client-side scripting in web browsers, enabling interactive web pages and user interfaces. JavaScript supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It's also used server-side through Node.js, for desktop application development with frameworks like Electron, and in various other contexts. The language features dynamic typing, first-class functions, and prototype-based object-orientation. JavaScript's ubiquity in web development, coupled with its versatility and continuous evolution through ECMAScript standards, has made it one of the most popular programming languages in use today.
