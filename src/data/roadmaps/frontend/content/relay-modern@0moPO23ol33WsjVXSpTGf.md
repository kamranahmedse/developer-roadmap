# Relay Modern

Relay is a JavaScript framework developed by Facebook for building data-driven React applications. It's specifically designed to work with GraphQL, providing a declarative approach to fetching and managing data in complex web applications. Relay optimizes data fetching by colocating data requirements with components, enabling efficient updates and minimizing over-fetching. It handles caching, real-time updates, and optimistic UI updates out of the box. Relay's architecture promotes scalability and performance in large applications by managing data dependencies and reducing network requests. While it has a steeper learning curve compared to simpler data-fetching solutions, Relay offers significant benefits for applications with complex data requirements, especially when used in conjunction with React and GraphQL.
