# Relay Modern

Relay is a Facebook JavaScript tool for React apps that use a lot of data. It works with GraphQL to get and manage data efficiently. Relay puts data needs next to components, so it only fetches what's needed and updates well. It handles caching, live updates, and quick UI changes. Relay helps big apps perform better by managing data smartly. It's a bit harder to learn but great for complex data needs with React and GraphQL.
