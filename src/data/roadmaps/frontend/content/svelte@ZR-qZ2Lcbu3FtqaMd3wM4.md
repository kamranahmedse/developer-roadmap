# Svelte

Svelte is a JavaScript tool for building UIs. Unlike others, Svelte does its main work during build time, not in the browser. It turns your code into small, fast, plain JavaScript. Svelte uses components and has a simple syntax, so you write less code. It includes features for managing data, styling, and animations. Because Svelte doesn't use a virtual DOM, pages load and update quickly. It's liked for its simplicity and speed.
