# Tanstack Start

Tanstack Start is a full-stack framework built on React that simplifies the process of creating web applications with server-side rendering (SSR). It provides tools and conventions for routing, data fetching, and deployment, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than configuring infrastructure. It aims to streamline the development workflow for React-based SSR applications.
