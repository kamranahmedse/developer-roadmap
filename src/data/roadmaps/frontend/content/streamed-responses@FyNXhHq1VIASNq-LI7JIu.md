# Streamed Responses

Streamed responses involve sending data from a server to a client in chunks, rather than waiting for the entire response to be ready before sending anything. This allows the browser to start processing and rendering content sooner, improving perceived performance and user experience, especially for large datasets or long-running processes. Instead of a single, large download, the data arrives incrementally.
