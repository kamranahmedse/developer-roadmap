# Documentation Generation with AI

AI-powered documentation generation leverages machine learning models to automatically create and maintain software documentation. These tools can analyze code, comments, and other project artifacts to produce API references, tutorials, and other types of documentation, reducing the manual effort required and ensuring accuracy and consistency. This helps developers by freeing them from manual tasks and ensuring that their APIs are well documented.
