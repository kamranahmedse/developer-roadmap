# ESLint

ESLint is a popular open-source static code analysis tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code. It enforces coding standards, detects potential errors, and promotes consistent coding practices across projects. ESLint is highly configurable, allowing developers to define custom rules or use preset configurations. It supports modern JavaScript features, JSX, and TypeScript through plugins. ESLint can be integrated into development workflows through IDE extensions, build processes, or git hooks, providing real-time feedback to developers. Its ability to automatically fix many issues it detects makes it a valuable tool for maintaining code quality and consistency, especially in large teams or projects. ESLint's extensibility and wide adoption in the JavaScript ecosystem have made it a standard tool in modern JavaScript development.
