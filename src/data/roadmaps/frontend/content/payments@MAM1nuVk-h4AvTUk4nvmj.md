# Payments

The Payment Request API is a web API that allows web developers to build checkout flows within their web applications. It provides a standardized, browser-based interface for collecting payment and shipping information from the user, and it supports a wide range of payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets. To use the Payment Request API, a web page must first create a `PaymentRequest` object and specify the payment and shipping options that are available to the user. The page can then invoke the Payment Request UI by calling the `show()` method on the `PaymentRequest` object. The user can then select their preferred payment and shipping options and confirm the payment, at which point the Payment Request API will return a payment response object that can be used to complete the transaction.
