# Deployment

Deployment is the process of making a website or web application available for users to access on the internet. It involves taking the code, assets (like images and fonts), and configuration files and placing them on a server or hosting platform. This process often includes steps like bundling the code, optimizing assets for performance, and configuring the server to properly serve the application.
