# Eleventy

Eleventy (11ty) is a simple to use, easy to customize, highly performant and powerful static site generator with a helpful set of plugins (e.g. navigation, build-time image transformations, cache assets). Pages can be built and written with a variety of template languages (HTML, Markdown, JavaScript, Liquid, Nunjucks, Handlebars, Mustache, EJS, Haml, Pug or JS template literals). But it also offers the possibility to dynamically create pages from local data or external sources that are compiled at build time. It has zero client-side JavaScript dependencies.
