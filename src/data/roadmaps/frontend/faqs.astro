    question: 'Is Frontend Development really coding?',
    answer: [
      'Do frontend developers really code? The answer is yes, absolutely.',
      'The fact that frontend developers are full-time developers who produce an output that is visually appealing (thanks to the designs provided by others) sometimes confuses others, making them believe that frontend developers aren\’t really coding. However, that couldn\’t be further from the truth.',
      'As a frontend developer, you\’ll be coding all the time.',

    question: 'How is Frontend Development different from Backend Development?',
    answer: [
      'The main difference between frontend development and backend development is that frontend development focuses on the UI, while [backend development](https://roadmap.sh/backend) focuses more on the server-side logic.',
      'You see, frontend development works with the user interface and user experience, dealing with the design, layout, and interactivity of a website or application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or TypeScript).',
      'On the other hand, backend development handles the server-side logic, databases, and application functionality, ensuring data is processed and served correctly. The tech stack for backend development is much bigger with more options, such as Python, Java, or Node.js.',
      'Both options are equally interesting and challenging, so it\’s not really a question of backend vs frontend, but instead of understanding where you feel more comfortable and what type of systems you enjoy creating.',
