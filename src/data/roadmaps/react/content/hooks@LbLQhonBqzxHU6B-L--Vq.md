#Hooks
React Hooks, introduced in version 16.8, let you use React features like state and lifecycle methods inside functional components without writing classes. They make code cleaner, reusable, and easier to understand. Common hooks include useState for managing state, useEffect for handling side effects, useContext for context data, and useRef for persisting values or accessing DOM elements. Hooks also improve performance through useMemo and useCallback. You can create custom hooks to reuse logic across components. They follow strict rulesâ€”only call hooks at the top level and inside React functions. Overall, hooks simplify component logic, improve reusability, and modernize how React apps are written.
