# Types & Validation

In Next.js, there are two major/optimal/fresh tools for types & validation: 
First is **Typescript**. It allows small/medium/large organization & team don't shot itself in a foot. It provides a static type system like in most low-level languages on a **developing** side. 
**_Mention that TypeScript, basically disappears after interpretation process. So we can't rely on it to validate a client's input._**
Second one **Zod**. On the other hand, is fresh and powerful **_TypeScript only_**(supports TS instead of JS) validation library. It allows us to cover weak points of typescript. It can exist wherever **TypeScript can't**. Zod can validate: form input, local storage, API contracts and many more
