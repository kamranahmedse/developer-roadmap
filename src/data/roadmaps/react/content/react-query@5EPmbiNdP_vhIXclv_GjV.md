# TanStack Query

TanStack Query, previously known as React Query, is a powerful library for fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server state in your React applications. It simplifies the process of handling asynchronous data, reducing boilerplate code and improving the user experience by providing features like automatic retries, background updates, and optimistic updates. It essentially helps you manage data fetching and caching in a declarative and efficient way.
