# GitHub

GitHub is a website and service that helps developers store and manage their code. Think of it like a cloud-based folder where you can keep all your project files. It also allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time without messing each other's work up, using a system called version control. This makes it easier to collaborate and track changes to your code.
