CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. It controls things like the colors, fonts, layout, and overall visual presentation of a website, ensuring it's both appealing and easy to navigate for users. Think of it as the makeup artist for your website, taking the basic structure provided by HTML and making it beautiful.
