# Vitest

Vitest is a testing framework powered by Vite. It's designed to be fast and easy to use, especially for projects that already use Vite for development. Vitest allows you to write unit tests and integration tests for your frontend code, ensuring that your components and functions work as expected. It offers features like hot module replacement (HMR) during testing, a watch mode for automatically re-running tests on file changes, and compatibility with popular testing libraries like Jest.
