# React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you break down complex UIs into smaller, reusable components. These components manage their own data and can be composed together to create larger applications. React uses a declarative approach, meaning you describe what you want the UI to look like, and React takes care of updating the DOM efficiently.
