# Git

Git is like a save button for your code, but way more powerful. It's a system that tracks changes you make to your files, so you can easily go back to earlier versions, compare different versions, and collaborate with others on the same project without messing up each other's work. Think of it as a detailed history book for your code, allowing you to experiment and fix mistakes without fear of losing progress.
