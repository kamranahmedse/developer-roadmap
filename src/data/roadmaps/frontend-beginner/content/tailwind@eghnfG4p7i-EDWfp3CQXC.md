# Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. Instead of providing pre-designed components like buttons or navigation bars, it gives you a set of pre-defined CSS classes that you can use directly in your HTML to style your elements. This allows for highly customized designs without writing custom CSS from scratch, offering a faster and more flexible way to style your web pages.
