# npm

npm is like a personal assistant for your coding projects. It's a tool that helps you easily manage and share code packages (like pre-written bits of code that do specific things) in your projects. Think of it as an app store, but for code. You can use it to install, update, and uninstall these packages, making it much easier to use other people's code and share your own.
