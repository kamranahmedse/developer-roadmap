# Pre-Order Traversal

Pre-order traversal is a way to visit every node in a tree data structure. It follows a specific order: first, the current node is processed (or visited). Then, the left subtree of the current node is traversed using pre-order. Finally, the right subtree of the current node is traversed using pre-order. This "node-left-right" sequence ensures each node is visited exactly once.
