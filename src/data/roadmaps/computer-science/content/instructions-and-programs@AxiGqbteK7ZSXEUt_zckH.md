# Instructions and Programs

Instructions are the most basic commands a CPU can understand, directing it to perform specific actions like adding numbers or moving data. A program, on the other hand, is a collection of these instructions, organized in a sequence to accomplish a particular task. Think of instructions as individual words and a program as a complete sentence or story; the CPU executes these instructions one by one, following the program's logic, to achieve the desired outcome.
