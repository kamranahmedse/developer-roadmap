# P = NP

The P = NP problem is one of the most famous problems in computer science. It asks whether a problem that can be solved in polynomial time on a non-deterministic machine (i.e., the problem is in NP) can also be solved in polynomial time on a deterministic machine (i.e., the problem is in P).

If you can find a polynomial-time solution to an NP-complete problem, then all problems in NP can be solved in polynomial time. This shows that P = NP.

If you can prove for any single NP-complete problem that it is only solvable in exponential time, then all NP-complete problems are only solvable in exponential time. This shows that P ≠ NP.

So far, we don't know whether P = NP or P ≠ NP.
