# Common Runtimes

Given below is the list of common algorithmic runtimes. The runtimes are listed in ascending order of their complexity.

- O(1) - Constant
- O(log n) - Logarithmic
- O(n) - Linear
- O(n log n) - Linearithmic
- O(n^2) - Quadratic
- O(n^3) - Cubic
- O(2^n) - Exponential
- O(n!) - Factorial
- O(n^k) - Polynomial
