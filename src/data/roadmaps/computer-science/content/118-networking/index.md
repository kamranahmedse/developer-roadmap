Networking is the process of connecting two or more computing devices together for the purpose of sharing data. In a data network, shared data may be as simple as a printer or as complex as a global financial transaction.

If you have networking experience or want to be a reliability engineer or operations engineer, expect questions from these topics. Otherwise, this is just good to know.
