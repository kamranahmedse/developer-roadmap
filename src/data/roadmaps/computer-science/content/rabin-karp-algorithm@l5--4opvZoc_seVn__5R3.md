# Rabin-Karp's algorithm

Rabin-Karp algorithm is a string searching algorithm that uses hashing to find any one of a set of pattern strings in a text. For strings of average length `n`, it performs in `O(n+m)` time with `O(m)` space, where `m` is the length of the pattern. It is often used in bioinformatics to search for DNA patterns.
