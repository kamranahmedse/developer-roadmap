# CPU Interrupts

CPU Interrupts are a way for the CPU to communicate with the rest of the computer. They are a way for the CPU to tell the rest of the computer that it needs to do something. For example, if the CPU is running a program and it needs to read from the keyboard, it will send an interrupt to the keyboard to tell it to send the data to the CPU. The CPU will then wait for the keyboard to send the data and then continue running the program.
