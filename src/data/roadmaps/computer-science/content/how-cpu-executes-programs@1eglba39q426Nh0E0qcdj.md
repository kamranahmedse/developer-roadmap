# How CPU Executes Programs?

The CPU executes programs by repeatedly fetching instructions from memory, decoding them to understand the operation, and then executing those operations. This cycle, called the fetch-decode-execute cycle, continues for each instruction in the program, with the CPU using registers for temporary storage and a program counter to keep track of the next instruction. Modern CPUs use techniques like pipelining and caches to speed up this process, enabling them to execute complex programs efficiently.
