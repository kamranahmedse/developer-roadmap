# Maze Solving Problem

Maze solving problem is a classic problem in computer science. It is a problem where we have to find a path from a starting point to an end point in a maze. The maze is represented as a grid of cells. Each cell can be either a wall or a path. The path cells are connected to each other. The starting point and the end point are also given. The goal is to find a path from the starting point to the end point. The path can only be made up of path cells. The path cannot go through the wall cells.
