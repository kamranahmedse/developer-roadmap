# B-Trees

Fun fact: it's a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer (co-inventor).

In Practice: B-Trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees (or Variants). In addition to its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block i address into a disk block (or perhaps to a cylinder-head-sector) address
