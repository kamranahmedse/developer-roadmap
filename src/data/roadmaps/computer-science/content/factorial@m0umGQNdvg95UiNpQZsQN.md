# Factorial

Factorial complexity algorithms have a runtime of `O(n!)`. This is the worst case scenario for an algorithm. Factorial complexity algorithms are very inefficient and should be avoided.

    def generate_permutations(s):
        # Base case: If the string length is 1, return a list containing the string
        if len(s) == 1:
            return [s]
    
        # Initialize the result list
        permutations = []
    
        # Recursively generate all permutations
        for i in range(len(s)):
            # Current character
            current_char = s[i]
            # Remaining characters
            remaining_chars = s[:i] + s[i + 1 :]
            # Generate all permutations of the remaining characters
            for perm in generate_permutations(remaining_chars):
                # Add the current character to the front of each generated permutation
                permutations.append(current_char + perm)
    
        return permutations
