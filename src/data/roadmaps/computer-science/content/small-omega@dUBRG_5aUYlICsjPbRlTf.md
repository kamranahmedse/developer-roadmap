# Small Omega

Small Omega (ω) notation is used to describe a lower bound on the growth rate of a function. Specifically, it indicates that a function *g(n)* grows strictly slower than another function *f(n)* as *n* approaches infinity. This means that for any constant *c > 0*, there exists a value *n₀* such that *g(n) < c*f(n)* for all *n > n₀*. In simpler terms, *f(n)* is a strict lower bound for *g(n)*.
