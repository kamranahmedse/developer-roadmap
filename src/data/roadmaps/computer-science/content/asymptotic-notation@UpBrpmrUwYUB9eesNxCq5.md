# Asymptotic Notation

The efficiency of an algorithm depends on the amount of time, storage and other resources required to execute the algorithm. The efficiency is measured with the help of asymptotic notations.

An algorithm may not have the same performance for different types of inputs. With the increase in the input size, the performance will change.

The study of change in performance of the algorithm with the change in the order of the input size is defined as asymptotic analysis.
