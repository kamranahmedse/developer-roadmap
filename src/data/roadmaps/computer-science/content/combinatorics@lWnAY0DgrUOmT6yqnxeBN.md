# Combinatorics

Combinatorics is the study of counting. It is a branch of mathematics that is used to solve problems in a variety of fields, including computer science, statistics, and physics. In computer science, combinatorics is used to solve problems related to counting the number of possible outcomes of a given problem. For example, if you are given a set of 10 objects, how many different ways can you arrange them? Or, if you are given a set of 10 objects, how many different ways can you choose 3 objects from that set? These are examples of combinatorial problems.
