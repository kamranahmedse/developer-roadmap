# Prim's Algorithm

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. A minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. A minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph is also called a minimum weight spanning tree or minimum cost spanning tree.
