# Skip Lists

Skip lists are a data structure that allows you to perform operations on a sorted list in O(log n) time. Skip lists are a probabilistic data structure, which means that the probability of a certain operation taking a certain amount of time is a certain value. In the case of skip lists, the probability of an operation taking O(log n) time is 1.
