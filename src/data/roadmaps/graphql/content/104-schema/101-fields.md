# Fields

In GraphQL, a field is a unit of data that can be queried or manipulated in a request. Each field has a name, a type, and an optional description. Fields are defined within an object type in a GraphQL schema.

Each field in a GraphQL schema can return a scalar value (such as a string or an integer) or another object, allowing for the creation of complex, nested data structures. The fields can also take arguments, which allows to filter or modify the data being returned.
