# Lists

In GraphQL, a list is a type that represents an ordered collection of items. Lists are defined using square brackets, with the type of the items inside.

Lists are used to represent an array of items in a GraphQL schema, and can be used as the return type for a field in an object type. Lists can contain any type of items, including scalars and other objects, and can also be nested within other lists.
