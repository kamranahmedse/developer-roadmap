# GraphQL on the Backend

In GraphQL, the backend refers to the server-side of the application, where the data is stored and processed.

When using GraphQL on the backend, developers can create a GraphQL server that handles the incoming GraphQL queries and mutations from the frontend. This can be implemented using a GraphQL library or framework, such as Apollo Server, Express-GraphQL, or GraphQL-Java.

The GraphQL server is responsible for handling the incoming queries and mutations, validating them against a schema, and executing them by fetching data from the database or other data sources. The server then returns the requested data to the client in a predictable format, as defined by the schema.
