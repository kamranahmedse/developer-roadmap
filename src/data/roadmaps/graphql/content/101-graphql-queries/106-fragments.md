# Fragments

In GraphQL, a fragment is a reusable piece of a GraphQL query that can be used to retrieve specific fields from one or more types of data. A fragment is defined using the "fragment" keyword, followed by the name of the fragment and the type of data it is querying. The fields to be retrieved are then specified within curly braces.
