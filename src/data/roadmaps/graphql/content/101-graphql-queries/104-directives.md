# Directives

Directives in GraphQL are a way to modify the execution of a query or a field. They are used to add additional behavior or validation to a query or a field, and can be applied to fields, operations (queries and mutations) and fragments. Directives can take one or more arguments to configure their behavior, and can be defined by the developer or used one of the built-in directives provided by GraphQL.
