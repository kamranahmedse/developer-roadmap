# Authorization

Authorization in GraphQL controls access to data and operations based on user permissions and roles. It can be implemented at the schema level, field level, or within resolvers, ensuring users only access data they're permitted to see through various authentication and permission strategies.

There are several ways to implement authorization in GraphQL:

- Using middleware
- Using schema directives
- Using a data source layer
