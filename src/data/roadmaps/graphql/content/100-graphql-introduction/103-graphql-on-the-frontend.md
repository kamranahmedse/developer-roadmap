# GraphQL on the Frontend

In GraphQL, the frontend refers to the client-side of the application, typically the web or mobile app that the end-user interacts with.

When using GraphQL on the frontend, developers can use a GraphQL client library, such as Apollo Client or Relay, to interact with the GraphQL server. These libraries provide a way to easily send GraphQL queries and mutations to the server and handle the response.

By using GraphQL on the frontend, developers can benefit from the flexibility and efficiency of GraphQL when querying data. Instead of having to make multiple REST API calls or hardcode data into the frontend, the client can specify exactly the data it needs in a single request, and the server will return it in a predictable format.
