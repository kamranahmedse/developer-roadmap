# Thinking in Graphs

"Thinking in Graphs" is a mindset or approach when working with GraphQL. It refers to the way that data is organized and queried in GraphQL, which is based on the concept of a graph.

In GraphQL, data is represented as a graph, where nodes represent objects and edges represent relationships between them. This allows for a more flexible and intuitive way of querying data, as the client can specify exactly the data it needs by following the relationships between nodes in the graph.
