# Defer Stream Directives

In GraphQL, the "defer" and "stream" directives are used to control the handling of fields and their associated data. These directives allow developers to control how data is fetched and sent over the network, and can be used to optimize the performance of a GraphQL API.

The "defer" directive is used to delay the fetching of a field's data until the data is actually needed by the client. This can be useful for improving the performance of an API by reducing the amount of data that needs to be fetched upfront.
