# What are Subscriptions

In GraphQL, subscriptions are a way to push real-time updates to the client. They allow a client to subscribe to a specific event or data change on the server, and receive updates in real-time as soon as the event occurs or the data changes.

Subscriptions are defined on the server and are structured similar to queries and mutations. They have a "subscription" field at the top level, followed by the fields that define the event or data change to be subscribed to.
