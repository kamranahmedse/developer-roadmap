# Pagination

Pagination in GraphQL refers to the process of breaking up large sets of data into smaller chunks, also known as pages, and providing a way to navigate between these pages. This allows clients to retrieve a specific subset of data, rather than having to retrieve all of the data at once, which can be beneficial for performance, especially when working with large datasets.

There are several ways to implement pagination in GraphQL:

- Cursor-based pagination
- Offset-based pagination
- Relay-style pagination
