# Producing The Result

In GraphQL, producing the result refers to the process of generating the final response to a query or mutation. This includes executing the resolvers for the selected fields, gathering the data, and formatting the response according to the requirements of the query or mutation.

When a client sends a query or mutation to a GraphQL server, the server performs several steps to produce the result:

- Parsing: The query or mutation is parsed and converted into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
- Validation: The query or mutation is validated against the schema to ensure that it is well-formed and adheres to the schema definition.
- Execution: The resolvers for the selected fields are executed, and the data is retrieved from the data source.
- Formatting: The data is formatted and organized into the final response, according to the requirements of the query or mutation.
