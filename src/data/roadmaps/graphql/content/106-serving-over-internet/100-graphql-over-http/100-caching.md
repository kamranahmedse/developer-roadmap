# Caching

Caching is a technique that is used to improve the performance of a GraphQL server by reducing the number of requests that need to be made to the data source. It works by storing a copy of the data that has been requested by a client in a cache, and then returning that data from the cache instead of the data source when the same data is requested again.

There are several types of caching that can be used in GraphQL:

- Client-side caching
- Server-side caching
- CDN caching
