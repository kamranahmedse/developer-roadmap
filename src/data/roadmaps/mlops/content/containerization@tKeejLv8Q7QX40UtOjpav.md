# Containerization

Containerization is a form of operating system virtualization that packages an application and its dependencies into a single, isolated unit called a container. This container includes everything the application needs to run, such as code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers offer a consistent and portable environment for applications, ensuring they run the same way regardless of where they are deployed.
