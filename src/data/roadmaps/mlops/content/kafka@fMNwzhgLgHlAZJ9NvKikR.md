# Kafka

Kafka is a distributed, fault-tolerant, high-throughput streaming platform. It's primarily used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications, allowing you to publish, subscribe to, store, and process streams of records. These streams can originate from various sources and be consumed by multiple applications simultaneously.
