# TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open-source software library created by Google for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that allows researchers and developers to build and deploy ML-powered applications. TensorFlow is particularly well-suited for deep learning tasks, enabling the creation of complex neural networks for image recognition, natural language processing, and more.
