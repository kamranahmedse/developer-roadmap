# Continuous Machine Learning (CML)

Continuous Machine Learning (CML) is a tool designed to bring continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) principles to machine learning projects. It allows data scientists and machine learning engineers to automate the process of training, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models. CML integrates with existing CI/CD systems to provide feedback on model performance and data quality with each code change.
