# AWS / Azure / GCP

AWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure and GCP (Google Cloud Platform) are three leading providers of cloud computing services. AWS by Amazon is the oldest and the most established among the three, providing a breadth and depth of solutions ranging from infrastructure services like compute, storage, and databases to the machine and deep learning. Azure, by Microsoft, has integrated tools for DevOps, supports a large number of programming languages, and offers seamless integration with on-prem servers and Microsoft’s software. Google's GCP has strength in cost-effectiveness, live migration of virtual machines, and flexible computing options. All three have introduced various MLOps tools and services to boost capabilities for machine learning development and operations.
