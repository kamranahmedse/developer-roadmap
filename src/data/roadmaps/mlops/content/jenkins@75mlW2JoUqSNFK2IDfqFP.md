# Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate the software development processes, including building, testing, and deploying code. It provides a platform for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), allowing teams to automate repetitive tasks and streamline their workflows. Jenkins uses plugins to support various tools and technologies, making it highly customizable and adaptable to different project requirements.
