# Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to analyze data with complex structures. These networks learn hierarchical representations of data, where each layer extracts increasingly abstract features from the previous layer. This allows deep learning models to automatically discover intricate patterns and relationships in data, making them particularly effective for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
