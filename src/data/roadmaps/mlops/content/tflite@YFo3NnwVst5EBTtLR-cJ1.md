# TFLite

TFLite is a lightweight version of TensorFlow, designed for running machine learning models on mobile, embedded, and IoT devices. It enables on-device inference, meaning models can be executed directly on the device without needing a network connection or relying on cloud-based processing. This reduces latency, improves privacy, and allows for offline functionality.
