# Orchestration & Deployment

Orchestration and deployment involve automating the process of taking a trained machine learning model and making it available for use in a production environment. This includes managing the workflow of model building, testing, and releasing, as well as handling the infrastructure needed to serve the model and scale it to meet demand. It ensures that models are reliably and efficiently integrated into applications and systems.
