# Airflow

Airflow is a platform used to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It allows you to define workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of tasks, where each task represents a unit of work. Airflow then executes these tasks in the specified order, handling dependencies, retries, and logging along the way.
