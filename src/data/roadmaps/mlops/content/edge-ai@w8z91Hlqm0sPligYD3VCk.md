# Edge AI

Edge AI refers to running machine learning models directly on devices, like smartphones, sensors, or embedded systems, rather than relying on a central server or cloud infrastructure. This approach brings computation and data processing closer to the source of data generation. This enables faster response times, reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and the ability to operate in environments with limited or no network connectivity.
