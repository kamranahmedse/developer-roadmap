# PyTorch

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework primarily developed by Meta AI. It's used for a variety of applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. PyTorch is known for its dynamic computation graph, which allows for more flexibility and easier debugging compared to static graph frameworks. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries to build and train neural networks.
