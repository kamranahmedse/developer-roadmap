# LIME

LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is a technique used to understand the predictions of machine learning models. It works by approximating the complex model with a simpler, interpretable model (like a linear model) in the vicinity of a specific prediction. This local approximation helps to understand which features are most important for that particular prediction, providing insights into why the model made that decision.
