# PyTorch Mobile

PyTorch Mobile is a framework that allows you to run PyTorch models directly on mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets. It enables on-device machine learning inference, meaning the model computations happen locally without needing a network connection to a remote server. This offers benefits like reduced latency, increased privacy, and the ability to function offline.
