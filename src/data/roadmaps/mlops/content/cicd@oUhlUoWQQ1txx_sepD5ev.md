# CI/CD

CI/CD, which stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment, is a software development practice focused on automating and streamlining the process of building, testing, and releasing software changes. Continuous Integration involves frequently merging code changes into a central repository, followed by automated builds and tests. Continuous Delivery/Deployment then automates the release of these changes to various environments, ultimately aiming for faster and more reliable software releases.
