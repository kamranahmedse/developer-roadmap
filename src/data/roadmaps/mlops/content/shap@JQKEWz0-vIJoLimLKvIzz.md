# SHAP

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a method used to explain the output of any machine learning model. It uses concepts from game theory to assign each feature a value representing its contribution to the prediction. These values, known as SHAP values, indicate the degree to which each feature contributed to the model's output for a specific instance, facilitating a deeper understanding of the model's decision-making process.
