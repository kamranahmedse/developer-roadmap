# Terraform

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. It enables you to manage infrastructure resources across various cloud providers and on-premises environments in a consistent and automated manner. Terraform uses a state file to track the current configuration of your infrastructure, allowing you to plan and apply changes safely and predictably.
