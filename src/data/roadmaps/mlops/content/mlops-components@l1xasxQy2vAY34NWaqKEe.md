# MLOps Components

MLOps components can be broadly classified into three major categories: Development, Operations and Governance. The **Development** components include everything involved in the creation of machine learning models, such as data extraction, data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning model training. The **Operations** category includes components involved in deploying, monitoring, and maintaining machine learning models in production. This may include release management, model serving, and performance monitoring. Lastly, the **Governance** category encompasses the policies and regulations related to machine learning models. This includes model audit and tracking, model explainability, and security & compliance regulations.
