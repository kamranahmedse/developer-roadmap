# DVC

DVC (Data Version Control) is an open-source tool designed to bring version control principles to machine learning projects, specifically for data and models. It extends Git's capabilities to handle large files, datasets, and machine learning models, which are typically not well-suited for traditional version control systems. DVC tracks changes to data and models, allowing you to reproduce experiments, revert to previous versions, and collaborate effectively on data-driven projects.
