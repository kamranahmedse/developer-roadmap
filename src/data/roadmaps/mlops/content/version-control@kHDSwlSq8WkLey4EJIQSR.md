# Version Control

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project without overwriting each other's work. This system tracks modifications to code, configurations, data, and other artifacts, providing a history of changes and enabling easy rollback to previous states.
