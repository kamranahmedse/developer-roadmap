# What is MLOps?

MLOps, short for Machine Learning Operations, is a set of practices that aims to reliably and efficiently deploy and maintain machine learning models in production. It bridges the gap between model development (Data Scientists) and model deployment (Operations), emphasizing automation, monitoring, and collaboration throughout the entire machine learning lifecycle. Think of it as DevOps, but specifically tailored for the unique challenges of machine learning.
