# Jetson

NVIDIA Jetson is a series of embedded computing systems designed for AI and robotics applications. These systems-on-modules (SoMs) provide high-performance processing capabilities in a compact, energy-efficient form factor, enabling developers to deploy AI models and perform complex computations directly on edge devices. Jetson platforms are commonly used in applications like autonomous vehicles, drones, smart cameras, and industrial automation, where real-time data processing and low latency are critical.
