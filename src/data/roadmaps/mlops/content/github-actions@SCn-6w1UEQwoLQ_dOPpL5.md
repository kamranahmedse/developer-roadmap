# GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your software development workflows directly in your GitHub repository. You can use it to build, test, and deploy your code, as well as automate other tasks like managing issues and pull requests. Workflows are defined in YAML files and triggered by events in your repository, such as pushes, pull requests, or scheduled times.
