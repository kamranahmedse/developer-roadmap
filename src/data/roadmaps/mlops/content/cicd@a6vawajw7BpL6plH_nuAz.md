# CI / CD

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery) is a software development practice that automates the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying updates. Continuous Integration focuses on regularly merging code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated testing to ensure code quality. Continuous Deployment extends this by automatically releasing every validated change to production, while Continuous Delivery ensures code is always in a deployable state, but requires manual approval for production releases. CI/CD pipelines improve code reliability, reduce integration risks, and speed up the development lifecycle.
