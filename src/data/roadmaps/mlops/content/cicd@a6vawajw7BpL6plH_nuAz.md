# CI/CD

CI/CD, which stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment, is a software development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. Continuous Integration focuses on frequently merging code changes into a central repository, followed by automated builds and tests. Continuous Delivery/Deployment then automates the release of these validated code changes to a staging or production environment.
