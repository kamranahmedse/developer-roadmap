# Data Lakes & Warehouses

Data lakes and data warehouses are both systems for storing large amounts of data, but they differ in structure and purpose. A data lake stores data in its raw, unprocessed format, allowing for flexibility in analysis and exploration. A data warehouse, on the other hand, stores data that has been structured and transformed for specific analytical purposes, often optimized for querying and reporting.
