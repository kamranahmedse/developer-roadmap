# Ansible

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used to configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks. It uses a simple, human-readable language (YAML) to define automation tasks, called playbooks. Ansible works by connecting to nodes (servers, virtual machines, etc.) and pushing out small programs called "Ansible modules" to them. These modules are then executed on the nodes, and the modules are removed when finished.
