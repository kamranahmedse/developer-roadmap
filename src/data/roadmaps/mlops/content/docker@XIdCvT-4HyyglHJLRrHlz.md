# Docker

Docker is a platform that uses operating system-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. These containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences between development and production environments. Docker simplifies the process of building, shipping, and running applications by packaging all dependencies, libraries, and configurations into a single unit.
