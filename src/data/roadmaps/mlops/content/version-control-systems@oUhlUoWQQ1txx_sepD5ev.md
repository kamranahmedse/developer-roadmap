# Version Control Systems

Version control systems are tools that manage changes to code, documents, and other files over time. They allow multiple people to collaborate on a project without overwriting each other's work, track the history of changes, and revert to previous versions if needed. These systems essentially create a detailed record of modifications, enabling efficient collaboration and easier debugging.
