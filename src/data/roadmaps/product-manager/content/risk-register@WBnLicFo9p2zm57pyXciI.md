# Risk Register

The Risk Register is an important tool for Product Managers as it systematically identifies and manages potential issues that could negatively impact the outcome of a product's development. It consists of a log of potential risks, quantifying their impact, likelihood, and mitigation strategies. This essential document allows Product Managers to prioritize strategies, allocate resources more efficiently, and develop contingency plans. In essence, a Risk Register helps Product Managers to better anticipate, assess, and prepare for the potential bumps on the road to successful product delivery. It encourages a proactive rather than reactive approach to managing risk, contributing to overall product success.
