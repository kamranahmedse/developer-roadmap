# TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) in Product Management

TRIZ is a problem-solving, analysis and forecasting tool derived from the study of patterns of invention in the global patent literature. In the realm of product management, TRIZ aids Product Managers to ideate innovative solutions, accelerate product development, solve complex problems and predict future technology trends. Understanding and applying TRIZ principles can empower Product Managers to overcome cognitive biases, break away from traditional patterns of thinking, and improve ideation and product innovation by providing systematic approaches and methodologies. 

# 1. Define the Problem 
Clearly articulate the problem, including the conflicting requirements (e.g - We want to improve performence without increasing cost).
# 2. Identify the Contradiction 
In TRIZ, a contradiction is a situation where improving one parameter e.g (Speed) leads to worsening another (e.g., energy consumption). TRIZ provides 39
universal engineering parameters to help classify the contradiction.

# 3.  Use the Contradiction Matrix
The matrix maps the conflicting parameters to a set of 40
inventive principles that have been repeatedly used in innovative solutions. By looking up the
row and column of the two conflicting parameters, the matrix suggests one or more principles to
apply.

# Apply the Inventive Principles
These principles (e.g., segmentation, taking out, asymmetry, etc.)
are general solutions that can be adapted to the specific problem.

# Ideal Final Result (IFR)
TRIZ encourages thinking about the ideal solution, which is the
situation where the system itself achieves the desired function without any additional cost,
weight, or complexity. This helps in thinking out of the box.

# Resources 
Look for unused resources in the system (e.g., space, time, materials, etc.) that can
be leveraged to solve the problem.

# Trends of Engineering System Evolution: 
TRIZ identifies patterns in how technical systems
evolve over time (e.g., increased dynamism, increased controllability, etc.). These trends can be
used to guide the development of the product.
