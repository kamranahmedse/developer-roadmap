# Job Stories

The concept of Job Stories is a tool integral to a Product Manager's dynamic role. Structured differently from traditional user stories, Job Stories shift the focus from personas to the situation, providing a fresh perspective for understanding user requirements. They provide an opportunity for product managers to emphasize the context and causality of user needs. This perspective plays a crucial role in creating successful products and ensuring they deliver value to the end-users. Teleriking why and when someone uses the product opens avenues for actionable insights leading to judicious decision-making in defining product requirements.
