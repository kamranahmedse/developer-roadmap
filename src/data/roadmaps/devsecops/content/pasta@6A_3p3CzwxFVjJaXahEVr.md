# PASTA

PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) is a risk-centric threat modeling methodology. It focuses on aligning security with business objectives by understanding the potential impact of threats on the organization's goals. It involves a seven-stage process that includes defining objectives, technical risk analysis, application decomposition, threat analysis, vulnerability analysis, attack modeling, and risk & impact analysis.
