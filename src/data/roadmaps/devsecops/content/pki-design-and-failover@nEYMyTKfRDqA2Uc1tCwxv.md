# PKI Design and Failover

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a system for creating, managing, distributing, using, storing, and revoking digital certificates. These certificates are used to verify the identity of users, devices, and services, enabling secure communication and data exchange. PKI design involves selecting appropriate certificate authorities, defining certificate policies, and establishing procedures for key management. Failover mechanisms ensure the continued availability of PKI services in the event of a system failure, preventing disruptions to security and operations.
