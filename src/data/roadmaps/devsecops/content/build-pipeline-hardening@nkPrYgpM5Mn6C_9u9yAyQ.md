# Build Pipeline Hardening

Pipeline hardening focuses on securing the automated process that transforms source code into deployable software. This involves implementing security measures at each stage of the pipeline, from code commit to artifact creation, to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced or exploited. The goal is to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the software being built and deployed.
