# Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) to protect its confidentiality. This is achieved using algorithms and cryptographic keys. Only authorized parties with the correct key can decrypt the ciphertext back into its original plaintext form, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected from unauthorized access or disclosure.
