# Secure API Design

Secure API design focuses on building application programming interfaces (APIs) that are resilient to attacks and protect sensitive data. This involves implementing security measures throughout the API lifecycle, from initial design and development to deployment and maintenance. Key considerations include authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, and rate limiting to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security vulnerabilities.
