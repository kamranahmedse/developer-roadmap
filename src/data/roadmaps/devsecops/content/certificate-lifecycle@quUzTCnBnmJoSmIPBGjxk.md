# Certificate Lifecycle

Certificate lifecycle management encompasses all the processes involved in creating, deploying, managing, and eventually revoking digital certificates. This includes requesting certificates from a Certificate Authority (CA), securely storing private keys, distributing certificates to servers and applications, monitoring certificate expiration dates, and renewing or replacing certificates before they expire to maintain secure communication and authentication.
