# Least Privilege

Least privilege is the concept of granting users or processes only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their required tasks. This means limiting access rights to only what is strictly needed, avoiding broad or unnecessary permissions. The goal is to reduce the potential damage that can result from accidental or malicious actions, such as data breaches or system compromises.
