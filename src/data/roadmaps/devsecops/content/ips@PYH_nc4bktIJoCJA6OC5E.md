# Intrusion Prevention Systems

An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a network security tool that monitors network traffic for malicious activity. It actively works to block or prevent detected threats, going beyond simple detection to take automated action. This can include terminating malicious sessions, blocking specific IP addresses, or alerting administrators to potential security breaches.
