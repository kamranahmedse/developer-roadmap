# DDoS Mitigation Strategy

A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) mitigation strategy is a plan and set of techniques used to protect a system or network from being overwhelmed by malicious traffic. It involves identifying, analyzing, and filtering out illegitimate requests while allowing legitimate users to access the service. This often includes a combination of traffic filtering, rate limiting, content delivery networks (CDNs), and other security measures to maintain availability and performance during an attack.
