# Incident Response

Incident Response is the structured approach an organization takes to address and manage the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack. It involves identifying, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from incidents to minimize damage and reduce recovery time and costs. The goal is to restore normal operations as quickly and efficiently as possible while preventing similar incidents from occurring in the future.
