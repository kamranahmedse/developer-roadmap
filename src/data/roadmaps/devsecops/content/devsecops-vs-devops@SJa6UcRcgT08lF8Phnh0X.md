# DevSecOps vs. DevOps

DevOps focuses on streamlining and automating the software development lifecycle, emphasizing collaboration between development and operations teams to deliver software faster and more efficiently.

This means security is a shared responsibility from the initial planning stages to deployment and monitoring.
