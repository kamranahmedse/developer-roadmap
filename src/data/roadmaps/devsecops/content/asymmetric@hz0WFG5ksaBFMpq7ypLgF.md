# Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key can be freely distributed, allowing anyone to encrypt data intended for the owner of the private key. Only the corresponding private key, which is kept secret, can decrypt the data. This method enables secure communication without the need to exchange secret keys beforehand.
