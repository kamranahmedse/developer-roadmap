# SBOMs

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a comprehensive inventory of all components, libraries, and dependencies used in building a software application. It's essentially a list that details the ingredients of your software, much like a nutrition label for food. This allows developers and security teams to understand the composition of their software and identify potential vulnerabilities or licensing issues associated with those components.
