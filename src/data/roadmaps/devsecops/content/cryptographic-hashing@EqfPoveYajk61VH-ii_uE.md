# Cryptographic Hashing

Cryptographic hashing is a process that takes an input (or 'message') and produces a fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash. This hash acts as a unique fingerprint of the input data. Even a small change to the input will result in a drastically different hash value. Hashing algorithms are designed to be one-way functions, meaning it's computationally infeasible to reverse the process and derive the original input from the hash.
