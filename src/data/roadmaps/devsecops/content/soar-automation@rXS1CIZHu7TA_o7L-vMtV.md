# SOAR Automation

SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) automation involves using technologies to collect security data from various sources, analyze it, and then automate responses to security incidents. This includes tasks like threat intelligence gathering, vulnerability scanning, incident investigation, and remediation actions. The goal is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of security operations by reducing manual effort and enabling faster response times to threats.
