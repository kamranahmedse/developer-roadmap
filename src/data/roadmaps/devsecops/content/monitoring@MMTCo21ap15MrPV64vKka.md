# Monitoring

Monitoring involves the systematic collection and analysis of data to track the performance, health, and security of systems and applications. It provides real-time visibility into the operational state, allowing teams to identify anomalies, detect potential issues, and proactively address them before they impact users or the overall system stability. This process typically involves setting up alerts and dashboards to visualize key metrics and logs, enabling quick response and informed decision-making.
