# Zero Trust Concepts

Zero Trust is a security framework based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." It assumes that no user or device, whether inside or outside the network perimeter, should be automatically trusted. Instead, every access request is fully authenticated, authorized, and encrypted before granting access to resources. This approach minimizes the blast radius of potential breaches and enhances overall security posture by continuously validating trust at every stage of digital interaction.
