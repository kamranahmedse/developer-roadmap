# DevSecOps

DevSecOps is an approach to software development that integrates security practices within the DevOps process. It emphasizes shared responsibility for security throughout the entire software lifecycle, from initial design to integration, testing, deployment, and software delivery. The goal is to build security into the development pipeline, rather than adding it as an afterthought, enabling faster and more secure software releases.
