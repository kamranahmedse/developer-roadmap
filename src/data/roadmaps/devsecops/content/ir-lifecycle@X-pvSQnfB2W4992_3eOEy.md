# IR Lifecycle

The Incident Response (IR) Lifecycle is a structured approach to managing and resolving security incidents. It outlines the key phases involved, from initial preparation and detection to containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activity. This lifecycle ensures a consistent and effective response to security breaches, minimizing damage and restoring normal operations as quickly as possible.
