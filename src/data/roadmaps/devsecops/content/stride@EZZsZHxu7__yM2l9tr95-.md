# STRIDE

STRIDE is a threat modeling methodology used to identify potential security threats in a system or application. It provides a framework for categorizing threats based on six key characteristics: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. By systematically analyzing these categories, security professionals can proactively identify vulnerabilities and design mitigations to reduce risk.
