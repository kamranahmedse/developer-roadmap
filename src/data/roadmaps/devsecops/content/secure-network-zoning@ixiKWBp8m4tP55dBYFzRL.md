# Secure Network Zoning

Secure network zoning involves dividing a network into distinct segments or zones, each with its own security policies and access controls. This segmentation limits the impact of a security breach by containing it within a specific zone, preventing attackers from easily moving laterally across the entire network. By implementing strict rules for traffic flow between zones, organizations can minimize the attack surface and protect sensitive data and systems.
