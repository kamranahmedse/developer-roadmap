# Input Validation Patterns

Input validation patterns are techniques used to ensure that data entered into an application conforms to expected formats and values. These patterns involve checking the length, type, format, and range of user-supplied data before it's processed by the application. By implementing these patterns, developers can prevent malicious or malformed data from causing errors, security vulnerabilities, or unexpected behavior within the system.
