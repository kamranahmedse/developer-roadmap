# SOC 2

SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) is an auditing procedure that ensures service providers securely manage data to protect the interests of their organization and the privacy of its clients. It defines criteria for managing customer data based on five "trust service principles": security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. A SOC 2 report assures customers that a service provider has implemented controls to protect their data.
