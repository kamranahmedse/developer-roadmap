# Response Strategy

A response strategy outlines the planned actions an organization will take when a security incident occurs. It defines roles, responsibilities, communication channels, and procedures for identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security breaches. A well-defined strategy ensures a coordinated and effective response, minimizing damage and restoring normal operations as quickly as possible.
