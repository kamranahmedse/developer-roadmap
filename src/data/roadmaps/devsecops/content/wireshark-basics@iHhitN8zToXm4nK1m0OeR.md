# Wireshark Basics

Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It captures network traffic in real-time and allows you to examine the data transmitted across a network. It can be used to troubleshoot network problems, analyze network protocols, examine security issues, and learn about network communication. Wireshark decodes the raw network data into a human-readable format, making it easier to understand the information being transmitted.
