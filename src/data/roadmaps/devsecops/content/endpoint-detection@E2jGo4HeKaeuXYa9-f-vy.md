# Endpoint Detection

Endpoint detection involves monitoring and analyzing activities on devices like laptops, desktops, and servers to identify suspicious behavior that could indicate a security threat. This process typically uses software agents installed on these endpoints to collect data, which is then analyzed for patterns and anomalies that might signal malware, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities. When a threat is detected, the system alerts security teams and may automatically take actions to contain or remediate the issue.
