# Rust

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Its memory safety features, achieved through a borrow checker and ownership system, help prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and data races. This makes Rust a valuable tool for building secure and reliable software components within a DevSecOps environment, especially for performance-critical applications and infrastructure tools.
