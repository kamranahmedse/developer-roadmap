# Log Analysis

Log analysis involves collecting, reviewing, and interpreting computer-generated records (logs) to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential security threats. These logs contain information about system events, user activities, and application behavior, providing valuable insights into the overall health and security posture of an environment. By examining log data, organizations can detect suspicious activities, troubleshoot issues, and improve their security defenses.
