# IAM

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a framework of policies and technologies that ensures the right individuals and services have appropriate access to resources. It defines and manages user identities, authenticates them, and authorizes their access to specific resources based on predefined roles and permissions. This helps organizations control who can access what, when, and how, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
