# Kubernetes Security

Kubernetes is a system for managing containerized applications. Securing Kubernetes involves protecting the cluster itself, the containers running within it, and the data they access. This includes controlling access to the Kubernetes API, securing network communication between pods, managing secrets and configurations safely, and ensuring the container images used are free from vulnerabilities.
