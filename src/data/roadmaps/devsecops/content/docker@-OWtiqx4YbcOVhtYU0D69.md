# Docker Security

Docker security entails protecting your applications and data within Docker containers. Because containers share the host operating system's kernel, vulnerabilities in the kernel or container configurations can be exploited. Securing Docker involves practices like using minimal base images, regularly scanning images for vulnerabilities, implementing strong access controls, and properly configuring Docker daemon settings to prevent unauthorized access and ensure isolation.
