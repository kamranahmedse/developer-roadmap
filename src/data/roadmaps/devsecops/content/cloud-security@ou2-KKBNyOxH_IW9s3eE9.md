Cloud security encompasses the policies, technologies, software, and practices that protect cloud-based systems, data, and infrastructure. It addresses the unique security challenges presented by cloud computing, such as shared responsibility models, data residency, and the dynamic nature of cloud environments. Effective cloud security strategies aim to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability of cloud resources while mitigating risks like data breaches, unauthorized access, and denial-of-service attacks.
