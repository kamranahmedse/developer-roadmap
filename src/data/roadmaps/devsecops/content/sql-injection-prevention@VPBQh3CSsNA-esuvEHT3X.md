# SQL Injection Prevention

SQL Injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when malicious SQL code is inserted into an application's database query. This can happen when user input is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in a SQL query. Successful exploitation can allow attackers to bypass security measures, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify or delete data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
