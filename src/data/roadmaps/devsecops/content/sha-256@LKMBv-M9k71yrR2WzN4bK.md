# SHA-256

SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function that generates a nearly unique 256-bit (32-byte) hash from any input data. This hash acts as a digital fingerprint, meaning even a small change to the input will result in a drastically different hash value. It's primarily used for verifying data integrity, digital signatures, and password storage due to its one-way nature, making it computationally infeasible to reverse the process and derive the original input from the hash.
