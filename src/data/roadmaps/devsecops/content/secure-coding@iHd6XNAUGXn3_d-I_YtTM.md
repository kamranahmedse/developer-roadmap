# Secure Coding

Secure coding involves developing software applications in a way that prevents vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of security breaches. It encompasses a set of practices and guidelines that developers follow throughout the software development lifecycle to minimize potential flaws that attackers could exploit. This includes techniques like input validation, output encoding, and proper error handling to ensure the application is resilient against common security threats.
