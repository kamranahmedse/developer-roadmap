# Attack Surface Mapping

Attack surface mapping is the process of identifying and documenting all the potential entry points or vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit to gain unauthorized access to a system or application. This involves cataloging all assets, including hardware, software, network components, and data, and then analyzing them to determine their susceptibility to various threats. The resulting map provides a clear picture of the organization's security posture, enabling security teams to prioritize mitigation efforts and reduce the overall risk.
