# Dependency Risk Management

Dependency Risk Management involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating the risks associated with using third-party libraries, frameworks, and other external components in software development. This includes understanding the potential vulnerabilities, licensing issues, and maintenance status of these dependencies to ensure the security and stability of the application. Effective dependency management helps prevent the introduction of known security flaws and ensures compliance with licensing requirements.
