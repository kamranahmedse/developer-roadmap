# Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses the same secret key for both encrypting and decrypting data. This means that the sender and receiver must both possess the same key before secure communication can begin. Algorithms like AES and DES are common examples, offering a balance between security and speed, making them suitable for encrypting large amounts of data.
