# PowerShell

PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation and configuration management framework, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language. It allows users to automate administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. PowerShell uses cmdlets (pronounced "command-lets") to perform specific actions, and these cmdlets can be combined into scripts to automate complex processes.
