Go, often referred to as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. Its simple syntax, efficient performance, and built-in concurrency features make it well-suited for building reliable and scalable tools and infrastructure components often used in DevSecOps pipelines. This includes tasks like automating security checks, building network tools, and creating efficient deployment systems.
