# DNS

DNS, or Domain Name System, is essentially the phonebook of the internet. It translates human-readable domain names, like "example.com," into IP addresses, like "192.0.2.1," which computers use to identify each other on the network. Without DNS, we'd have to remember and type in these numerical IP addresses every time we wanted to visit a website.
