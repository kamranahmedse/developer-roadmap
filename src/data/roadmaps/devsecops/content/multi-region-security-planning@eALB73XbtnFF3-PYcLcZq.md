# Multi-Region Security Planning

Multi-Region Security Planning involves designing and implementing security measures across multiple geographical locations where an application or service is deployed. This includes considering factors like data residency requirements, regional compliance regulations, and the potential for geographically isolated failures or attacks. The goal is to ensure consistent security posture and resilience, regardless of the region, while also optimizing for performance and cost.
