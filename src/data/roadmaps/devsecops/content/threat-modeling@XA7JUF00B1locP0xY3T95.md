# Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is a structured process for identifying, evaluating, and mitigating potential security threats and vulnerabilities in a system or application. It involves understanding the system's architecture, identifying potential attackers and their motives, and analyzing the possible attack vectors they might use to compromise the system. The goal is to proactively identify weaknesses and design security controls to reduce the risk of successful attacks.
