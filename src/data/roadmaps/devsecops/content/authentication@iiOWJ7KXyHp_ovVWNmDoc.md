# Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or application attempting to access a system or resource. It confirms that the entity is who or what it claims to be, typically by requiring them to provide credentials such as a username and password, a digital certificate, or biometric data. Successful authentication grants access based on pre-defined permissions and roles.
