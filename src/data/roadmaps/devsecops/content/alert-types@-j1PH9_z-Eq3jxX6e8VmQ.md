Alert types are the different categories or classifications of notifications generated by monitoring systems when specific events or conditions occur. These alerts signal potential issues, anomalies, or security threats within an application or infrastructure. They can range from simple notifications about resource utilization to complex warnings about potential security breaches, and are crucial for timely response and remediation.
