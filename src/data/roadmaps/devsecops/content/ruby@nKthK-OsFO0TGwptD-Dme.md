Its flexible syntax and powerful features make it useful for automating tasks, building tools, and scripting, which are all valuable in a DevSecOps environment. Ruby's extensive ecosystem of gems (libraries) provides pre-built solutions for various security and automation needs, allowing teams to quickly implement and integrate security practices into their development pipelines.
