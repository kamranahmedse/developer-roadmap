# bcrypt

bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed to be computationally intensive and resistant to brute-force attacks. It incorporates a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks and uses an adaptive hashing algorithm, meaning the computational cost can be increased over time to keep pace with advancements in computing power. This makes it a strong choice for securely storing user passwords.
