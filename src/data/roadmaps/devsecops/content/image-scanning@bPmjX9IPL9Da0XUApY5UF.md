# Image Scanning

Image scanning is the process of analyzing container images for known vulnerabilities, malware, and configuration issues. It involves examining the layers of the image, including the operating system, installed packages, and application code, against vulnerability databases and security policies. This helps identify potential risks before the image is deployed, ensuring a more secure container environment.
