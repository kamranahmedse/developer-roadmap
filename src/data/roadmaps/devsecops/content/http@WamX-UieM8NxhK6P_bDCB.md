# HTTP

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It's an application-layer protocol that defines how clients (like web browsers) and servers communicate by exchanging messages. These messages consist of requests from the client and responses from the server, enabling the transfer of resources like HTML documents, images, and other web content.
