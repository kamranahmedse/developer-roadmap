# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into websites viewed by other users. These scripts can then execute in the user's browser, potentially stealing sensitive information like cookies, redirecting the user to malicious sites, or defacing the website. Preventing XSS involves sanitizing user inputs, encoding outputs, and implementing security policies to ensure that untrusted data cannot be executed as code.
