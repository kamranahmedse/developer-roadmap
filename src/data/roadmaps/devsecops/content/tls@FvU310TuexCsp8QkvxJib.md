# TLS

TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications. It's the successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and is used to encrypt the communication between a client (like a web browser) and a server, ensuring that data transmitted between them remains confidential and tamper-proof. TLS uses cryptographic algorithms to encrypt data, authenticate the server (and optionally the client), and ensure the integrity of the data being transmitted.
