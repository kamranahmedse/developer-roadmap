# Audit & Compliance Mapping

Audit & Compliance Mapping involves aligning an organization's security controls and practices with relevant regulatory requirements, industry standards, and internal policies. This process identifies which controls satisfy specific compliance obligations, creating a clear relationship between security efforts and the necessary frameworks for legal and operational adherence. The goal is to demonstrate that the organization is meeting its obligations and to streamline the audit process by providing a structured view of compliance.
