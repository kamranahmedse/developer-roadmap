# Threat Modeling Workflows

Threat modeling workflows are structured, repeatable processes used to identify, assess, and mitigate potential security threats in a system or application. These workflows typically involve defining the system's scope, decomposing it into components, identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities, prioritizing those threats based on risk, and then developing and implementing mitigation strategies. The goal is to proactively address security concerns throughout the development lifecycle.
