# JavaScript and Node.js

JavaScript is a programming language primarily used for front-end web development, making websites interactive. Node.js, on the other hand, allows you to use JavaScript on the back-end, enabling server-side scripting and building scalable network applications. This means you can use JavaScript for both what the user sees and interacts with, and for the server logic that powers the application.
