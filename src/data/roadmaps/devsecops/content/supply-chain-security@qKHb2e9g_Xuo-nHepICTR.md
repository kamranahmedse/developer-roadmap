# Supply Chain Security

Supply chain security focuses on protecting the integrity and security of all components, processes, and people involved in the development and delivery of software. It aims to prevent malicious actors from introducing vulnerabilities or malicious code into the software supply chain, ensuring that the final product is trustworthy and free from tampering. This includes securing everything from open-source libraries and third-party dependencies to build pipelines and deployment environments.
