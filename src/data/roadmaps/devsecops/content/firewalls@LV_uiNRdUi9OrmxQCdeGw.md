# Firewalls

Firewalls are network security systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, such as the internet. Firewalls analyze network packets and either allow or block them based on configured rules, helping to prevent unauthorized access to or from private networks.
