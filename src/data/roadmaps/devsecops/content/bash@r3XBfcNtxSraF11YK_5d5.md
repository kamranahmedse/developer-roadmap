# Bash Scripting

Bash is a command-line interpreter and scripting language commonly used in Linux and macOS environments. It allows users to automate tasks, manage files, and execute programs through a series of commands written in a script. These scripts can range from simple one-liners to complex programs that perform system administration, software deployment, and other essential operations.
