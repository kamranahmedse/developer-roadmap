# Forensics

Forensics, in the context of incident response, involves the systematic investigation and analysis of security incidents to understand what happened, how it happened, and who was involved. It's about gathering and preserving digital evidence to reconstruct events, identify root causes, and support potential legal or disciplinary actions. This process helps organizations learn from incidents, improve their security posture, and prevent future occurrences.
