# SIEM

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a system that collects and analyzes security logs and event data from various sources across an organization's IT infrastructure. It helps security teams detect, analyze, and respond to security threats and incidents by providing a centralized view of security-related information and automating threat detection and incident response processes. SIEM systems typically include features such as log management, event correlation, threat intelligence integration, and reporting.
