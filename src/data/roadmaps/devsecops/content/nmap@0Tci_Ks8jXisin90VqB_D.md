# Nmap

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open-source utility used for network discovery and security auditing. It's designed to scan networks to determine available hosts, the services they offer, the operating systems they run, packet filters/firewalls, and many other characteristics. Nmap works by sending packets to target hosts and analyzing the responses.
