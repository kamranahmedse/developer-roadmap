# Key Management Service

A Key Management Service (KMS) is a secure system for creating, storing, and managing cryptographic keys. It provides a centralized platform to control access to these keys, ensuring that sensitive data is protected through encryption. KMS solutions often include features like key rotation, auditing, and integration with other security tools to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data.
