# Role-Based Access Control

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an organization. It assigns permissions and privileges to roles, and then assigns users to those roles, simplifying access management and improving security by ensuring users only have the access necessary to perform their job functions.
