# Intrusion Detection Systems

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. It analyzes network traffic, system logs, and other data sources to identify suspicious patterns that may indicate an attack or unauthorized access. When a threat is detected, the IDS alerts administrators, allowing them to investigate and respond to the incident.
