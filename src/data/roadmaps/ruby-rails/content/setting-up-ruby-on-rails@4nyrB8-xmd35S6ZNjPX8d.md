# Setting up Ruby on Rails

Setting up Ruby on Rails involves installing the necessary software and configuring your environment to develop and run Rails applications. This typically includes installing Ruby, the Rails gem, a database system (like PostgreSQL or MySQL), and any other dependencies required for your project. Once these components are installed, you can create a new Rails application using the `rails new` command and start building your web application.
