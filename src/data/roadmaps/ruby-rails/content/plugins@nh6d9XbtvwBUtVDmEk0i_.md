# Plugins

Plugins are self-contained packages of code that extend or modify the functionality of a Rails application. They provide a way to encapsulate reusable features, such as authentication, authorization, or payment processing, and easily integrate them into different Rails projects. Plugins can add models, controllers, views, helpers, and even modify the Rails framework itself.
