# Pry

Pry is a powerful Ruby runtime developer console and alternative to `irb`. It allows you to pause your code's execution at any point, inspect variables, step through code line by line, and even modify your code on the fly. This makes it an invaluable tool for understanding and debugging Ruby and Rails applications.
