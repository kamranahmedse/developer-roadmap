# Creating Controllers

Controllers are the logical center of your application, responsible for receiving specific requests from the user, interacting with the model to retrieve or save data, and then rendering a view to present that data back to the user. Creating a controller involves defining a Ruby class that inherits from `ApplicationController` and defining methods (called actions) within that class to handle specific routes and user interactions. These actions orchestrate the application's response to user input.
