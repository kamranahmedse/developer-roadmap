# CanCanCan

CanCanCan is an authorization library for Ruby on Rails applications that restricts what resources a given user is allowed to access. It provides a simple and flexible way to define abilities, which represent the permissions a user has on different resources, and then checks these abilities within your controllers and views to control access and display appropriate content. This gem helps in defining and managing user roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.
