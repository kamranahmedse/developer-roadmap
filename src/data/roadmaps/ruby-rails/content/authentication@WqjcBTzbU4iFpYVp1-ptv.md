# Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or other entity attempting to access a system or resource. It confirms that someone or something is who or what they claim to be, typically by checking credentials like usernames and passwords, or through more advanced methods like multi-factor authentication. Successful authentication grants access based on the verified identity.
