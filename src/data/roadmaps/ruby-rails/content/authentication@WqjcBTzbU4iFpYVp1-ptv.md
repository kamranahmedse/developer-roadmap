# Authentication

Authentication in Rails verifies the identity of users, ensuring they are who they claim to be before granting access to protected resources. It typically involves checking user credentials, like a username and password, against stored data to confirm their validity. Upon successful verification, a user session is created, allowing the application to remember the user across multiple requests without repeatedly asking for credentials. This process helps secure the application by restricting access to authorized users only.
