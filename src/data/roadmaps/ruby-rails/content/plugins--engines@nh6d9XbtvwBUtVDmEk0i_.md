# Plugins & Engines

Plugins and engines in Rails are both ways to package and reuse code, but they serve slightly different purposes. Plugins are typically smaller and used to add specific functionalities or modify existing behavior within a Rails application. Engines, on the other hand, are more self-contained and can act as mini-applications within a larger Rails application, often providing their own models, controllers, views, and routes.
