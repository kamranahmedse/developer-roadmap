# RSpec

RSpec is a testing framework for Ruby. It provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing tests that are easy to read and understand. RSpec focuses on behavior-driven development (BDD), allowing developers to describe the desired behavior of their code in a clear and concise manner, leading to more maintainable and reliable applications.
