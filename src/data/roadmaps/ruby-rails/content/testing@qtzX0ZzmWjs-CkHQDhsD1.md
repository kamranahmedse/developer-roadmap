# Testing

Testing in software development involves verifying that individual units of code (unit tests) and the application as a whole (integration and system tests) function as expected. It helps ensure code quality, prevents regressions, and facilitates easier refactoring by providing a safety net to catch errors early in the development process. Different types of tests, such as unit, integration, and system tests, focus on different aspects of the application to provide comprehensive coverage.
