# Deployment

Deployment is the process of making your Ruby on Rails application accessible to users on a live server. It involves configuring the server environment, transferring your application code, setting up databases, and ensuring the application runs smoothly and reliably in a production setting. This includes handling aspects like web server configuration, application server setup, database connections, and ongoing maintenance.
