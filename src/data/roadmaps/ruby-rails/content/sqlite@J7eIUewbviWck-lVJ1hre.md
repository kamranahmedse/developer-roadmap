# SQLite in Rails

SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database engine. It requires no separate server process and stores the entire database in a single file on disk. This makes it a convenient choice for development, testing, and small-scale applications where a full-fledged database server isn't necessary. Rails supports SQLite out of the box, making it easy to set up and use.
