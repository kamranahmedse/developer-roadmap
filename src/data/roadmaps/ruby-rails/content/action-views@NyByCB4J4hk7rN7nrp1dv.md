# Action Views

Action View is the view component of the Ruby on Rails framework. It's responsible for rendering the user interface, typically in HTML, but also in other formats like XML or JSON. It handles tasks such as template rendering, layout management, and helper methods to simplify the creation of dynamic web pages.
