# Helpers

Helpers in Rails are methods that you can use in your views to encapsulate complex logic, format data, or generate HTML. They promote code reusability and keep your views clean and readable by moving presentation-related code out of the templates. Helpers can be defined in application-wide helpers or controller-specific helpers.
