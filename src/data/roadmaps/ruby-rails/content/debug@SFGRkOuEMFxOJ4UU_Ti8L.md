# debug

The `debug` helper in Ruby on Rails provides a way to display the contents of a variable or object directly within your views. It's primarily used for debugging purposes, allowing you to quickly inspect data structures and identify issues in your code during development. When used, it outputs the object's information in a readable format within `<pre>` tags on the rendered HTML page, making it easy to examine its properties and values.
