# Active Record Conditions

Active Record conditions are used to specify criteria for retrieving data from a database table. They allow you to filter records based on specific attributes and values, enabling you to retrieve only the data that meets your desired requirements. These conditions are typically expressed using SQL-like syntax or through a more Ruby-friendly syntax provided by Active Record.
