# Creating a New Rails Application

Creating a new Rails application is the initial step in starting any Rails project. It involves using the `rails new` command, which sets up the basic directory structure, configuration files, and dependencies needed for a functional Rails application. This process bootstraps your project with a default set of tools and conventions, allowing you to quickly begin building your web application.
