# Factory Bot

Factory Bot is a library for creating Ruby objects for testing purposes. It provides a simple and clean syntax for defining factories, which are blueprints for creating instances of your models with pre-defined attributes. This helps to avoid repetitive setup code in your tests and ensures consistent test data.
