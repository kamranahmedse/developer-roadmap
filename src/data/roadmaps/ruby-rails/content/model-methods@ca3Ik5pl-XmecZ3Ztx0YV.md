# Model Methods

Model methods in Ruby on Rails are custom functions defined within a model class that encapsulate specific business logic related to that model. These methods allow you to perform operations on model instances or the model class itself, such as data validation, calculations, or interactions with other models, promoting code reusability and maintainability within your Rails application.
