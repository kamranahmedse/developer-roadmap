# Controller Actions

Controller actions are methods within a Rails controller that handle specific requests from users or other parts of the application. Each action typically corresponds to a specific route and performs a task, such as displaying a form, creating a new record, updating an existing record, or deleting a record. These actions interact with models to retrieve or manipulate data and then render a view to display the results to the user.
