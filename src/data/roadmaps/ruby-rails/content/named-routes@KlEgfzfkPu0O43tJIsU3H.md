# Named Routes

Named routes provide a convenient way to refer to specific routes within your application's code. Instead of hardcoding URLs, you can use a symbolic name that represents the route, making your code more readable and maintainable. These names are automatically generated based on your `routes.rb` file and can be used in views, controllers, and models to generate URLs and paths.
