# Controller Callbacks

Controller callbacks, often referred to as filters, are methods that are executed at specific points in the lifecycle of a controller action. They allow you to run code before, after, or around a controller action, providing a way to encapsulate common logic, such as authentication, authorization, or data preparation, and keep your controller actions clean and focused.
