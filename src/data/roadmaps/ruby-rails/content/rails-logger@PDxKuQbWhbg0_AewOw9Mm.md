# Rails Logger

The Rails Logger is a built-in component within Ruby on Rails that provides a standardized way to record events and messages during the execution of an application. It allows developers to track application behavior, diagnose issues, and monitor performance by writing information to various output destinations, such as files or the console. The logger offers different severity levels (e.g., debug, info, warn, error, fatal) to categorize messages based on their importance, enabling developers to filter and prioritize logged information effectively.
