# Dynamic Finders

Dynamic finders provide a convenient way to query your database based on specific attributes of your model. They allow you to create methods on the fly that search for records based on the values of those attributes, eliminating the need to write custom query methods for simple attribute-based searches. This feature simplifies data retrieval and makes your code more readable.
