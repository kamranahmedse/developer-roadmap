# Rendering Views

Rendering views in Ruby on Rails involves generating HTML (or other formats) to be displayed to the user. This process typically uses templates written in ERB or other templating languages, combining data from the controller with the template to produce the final output. Rails provides mechanisms for rendering different types of content, including partials, layouts, and collections, offering flexibility in structuring and organizing the presentation layer of an application.
