# Debugging

Debugging is the process of identifying and removing errors (bugs) from software. It involves systematically finding the source of a problem, understanding why it's happening, and then implementing a solution to fix it. Effective debugging relies on using tools and techniques to inspect code, track down unexpected behavior, and verify that the fix resolves the issue without introducing new problems.
