# Cookies in Rails Controllers

Cookies are small pieces of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store it and send it back with later requests to the same server. Rails controllers provide a convenient way to set, read, and delete cookies, allowing you to maintain state between requests, such as remembering user preferences or tracking session information.
