# Static Files

Within a Django project, the `static` folder is where you store static files like CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, and fonts. These files are essential for styling and adding interactivity to your web application's user interface. Django needs to know where to find these files to serve them correctly to the browser, and the `static` folder, usually located within each app directory, provides a standardized location for this purpose.
