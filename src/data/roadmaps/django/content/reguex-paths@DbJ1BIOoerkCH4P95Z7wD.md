# Regex Paths

Regular expression paths in Django provide a powerful and flexible way to define URL patterns. Instead of using simple string matching, you can use regular expressions to capture specific parts of the URL and pass them as arguments to your view functions. This allows you to create dynamic and complex URL structures that can handle a wide range of user requests.
