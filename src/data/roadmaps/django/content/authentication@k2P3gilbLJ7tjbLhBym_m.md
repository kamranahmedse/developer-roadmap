# Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or other entity attempting to access a system or resource. It confirms that someone or something is who or what they claim to be, typically by checking credentials like usernames and passwords against a stored database. Successful authentication grants access, while failure denies it.
