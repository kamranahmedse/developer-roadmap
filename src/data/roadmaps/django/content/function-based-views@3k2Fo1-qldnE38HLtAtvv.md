# Function-Based Views

Function-based views in Django are Python functions that take a web request and return a web response. They are a simple and direct way to handle HTTP requests and generate the appropriate output, such as HTML, JSON, or redirects. These views provide a basic structure for processing user input, interacting with models, and rendering templates.
