# Django Admin

Django Admin is a built-in interface in Django that allows you to easily manage your application's data. It provides a user-friendly way to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) records in your database tables through an automatically generated web interface, based on your models. This eliminates the need to build custom admin panels from scratch.
