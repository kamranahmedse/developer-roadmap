# unittest & TestCase

`unittest` is Python's built-in testing framework, providing a standard way to write and run tests. `TestCase` is a class within `unittest` that's used as a base class for creating individual test cases. You define methods within your `TestCase` subclass that represent specific tests, using assertions to check for expected outcomes.
