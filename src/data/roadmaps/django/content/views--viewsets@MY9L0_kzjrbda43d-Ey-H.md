# Views & ViewSets

Views in Django REST Framework handle the logic for processing incoming web requests and returning responses, similar to regular Django views. ViewSets provide a way to group related views into a single class, reducing code duplication and simplifying the creation of complex APIs by offering pre-built actions like list, create, retrieve, update, and delete.
