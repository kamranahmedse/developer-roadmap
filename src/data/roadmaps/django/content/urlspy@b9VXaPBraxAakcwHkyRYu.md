# URL Configuration in Django

In a Django project, `urls.py` files are responsible for mapping URL patterns to specific views. They act as a table of contents for your website, telling Django which view function to execute when a user visits a particular URL. Essentially, they define the structure of your website's addressable locations and how Django handles requests to those locations.
