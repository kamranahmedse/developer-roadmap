# Protecting Views

Protecting views in Django involves restricting access to certain parts of your web application based on user authentication and authorization. This ensures that only logged-in users, or users with specific permissions, can access sensitive data or perform certain actions. It's a fundamental aspect of web security, preventing unauthorized access and maintaining data integrity.
