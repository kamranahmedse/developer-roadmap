# Loggers

Loggers are the entry points in Django's logging system that your code uses to record events. They capture messages, optionally filter them based on severity levels (like DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL), and then pass them on to handlers. Handlers determine what to do with the log messages, such as writing them to a file, sending them via email, or displaying them on the console. You can configure multiple loggers, each with its own settings, to manage different parts of your application's logging needs.
