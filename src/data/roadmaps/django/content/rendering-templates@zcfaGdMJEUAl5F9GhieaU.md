# Rendering Templates

Rendering templates in Django involves combining data with a template file (usually written in HTML) to produce a final HTML output that is sent to the user's browser. This process allows developers to dynamically generate web pages, incorporating data from the server-side into the client-side presentation. Django's template engine provides a powerful and flexible way to separate the presentation logic from the application's business logic.
