# Templates

The `templates` folder in a Django project is where you store your HTML files. These HTML files define the structure and content of your web pages. Django uses a template engine to dynamically insert data from your Python code into these HTML files before sending them to the user's browser. This allows you to create dynamic and personalized web pages.
