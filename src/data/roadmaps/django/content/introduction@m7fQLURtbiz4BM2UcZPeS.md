# Introduction

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Django follows the model-template-views (MTV) architectural pattern, providing a structured way to build web applications.
