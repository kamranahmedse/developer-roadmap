# Comments in Django Templates

Comments in Django Template Language (DTL) allow developers to embed explanatory notes or temporarily disable sections of template code without affecting the rendered output. These comments are not visible to the end-user in the final HTML. They are useful for documenting the purpose of specific template logic, debugging, or experimenting with different template structures.
