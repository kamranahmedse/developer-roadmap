# Whitenoise

Whitenoise is a library that allows your web application to serve static files directly from its own WSGI server. This means you don't need to rely on a separate web server like Nginx or Apache to serve static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images. It simplifies deployment, especially in environments where configuring a separate static file server is complex or undesirable.
