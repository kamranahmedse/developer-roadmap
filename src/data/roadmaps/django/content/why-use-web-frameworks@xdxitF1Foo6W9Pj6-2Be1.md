# Web Frameworks

Web frameworks provide a structure and set of tools to streamline the development of web applications. They handle common tasks like routing URLs, managing sessions, interacting with databases, and ensuring security, allowing developers to focus on the unique features of their application rather than reinventing the wheel. This leads to faster development, more maintainable code, and improved security practices.
