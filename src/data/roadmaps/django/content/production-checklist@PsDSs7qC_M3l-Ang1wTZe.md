# Production Checklist

A production checklist is a structured list of tasks and configurations that need to be verified and completed before deploying a Django application to a live, production environment. It ensures that the application is secure, performant, and reliable for end-users by covering aspects like security settings, database configurations, static file handling, and monitoring setup.
