# Logging

Logging in Django provides a way to record events that occur while your application is running. It allows you to track errors, warnings, and other important information, which is crucial for debugging and monitoring your application's behavior in different environments. Django's logging system is based on Python's built-in `logging` module, offering flexibility in configuring how and where log messages are stored.
