# Django Test Framework

The Django test framework provides a structured environment for writing and running tests for Django applications. It includes tools for creating test cases, running tests, and asserting expected outcomes, ensuring that your code functions as intended and remains reliable as your project evolves. It allows developers to write unit tests, integration tests, and other types of tests to verify the correctness of their Django projects.
