# UpdateView

UpdateView is a class-based view in Django that simplifies the process of creating a view to handle updating an existing model instance. It provides a pre-built structure for displaying a form populated with the instance's data, processing the form submission, validating the data, and saving the updated instance to the database. This reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed for common update operations.
