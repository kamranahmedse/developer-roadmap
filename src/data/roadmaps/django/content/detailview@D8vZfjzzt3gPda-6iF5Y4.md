# DetailView

DetailView is a pre-built class-based view in Django that simplifies the process of displaying the details of a single object. It automatically fetches an object from the database based on a provided lookup (typically a primary key or slug) and renders it using a specified template. This eliminates the need to write repetitive code for common detail view scenarios.
