# Querying Data with Django ORM

The Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) provides a powerful and convenient way to interact with your database. Instead of writing raw SQL queries, you use Python code to retrieve data from your models. This involves using methods like `filter()`, `get()`, `all()`, and `exclude()` on your model's manager (usually `objects`) to specify the conditions for the data you want to retrieve. These methods return QuerySets, which are lazy-evaluated collections of model instances that match your criteria.
