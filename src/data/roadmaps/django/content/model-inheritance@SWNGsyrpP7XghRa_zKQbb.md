# Model Inheritance

Model inheritance in Django allows you to create new models that inherit fields and behaviors from existing models. This promotes code reuse and helps establish relationships between different data entities in your application. By inheriting from a base model, you can avoid redefining common fields and methods, making your code more organized and maintainable.
