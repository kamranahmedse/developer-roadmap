# tests.py

`tests.py` is a Python file within a Django app's directory that is dedicated to containing tests for that specific app. It allows developers to write and execute automated tests to ensure the app's functionality works as expected, covering various aspects like models, views, and forms. These tests help prevent bugs, ensure code quality, and facilitate easier refactoring and maintenance.
