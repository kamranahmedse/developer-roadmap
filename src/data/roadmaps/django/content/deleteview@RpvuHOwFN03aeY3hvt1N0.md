# DeleteView

`DeleteView` in Django is a pre-built class-based view designed to handle the deletion of a specific object from your database. It provides a structured way to present a confirmation page to the user, process the deletion upon confirmation, and then redirect the user to another page. This simplifies the process of creating views that handle object deletion, reducing boilerplate code.
