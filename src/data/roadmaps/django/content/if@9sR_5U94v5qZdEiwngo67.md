# Conditional Logic in Django Templates

The `if` tag in Django Template Language (DTL) allows you to control which parts of your template are rendered based on the truthiness of a variable or expression. It evaluates a variable, and if that variable is "true" (i.e., exists, is not empty, and is not a false boolean value), the block of code within the `if` tag is rendered. You can also use `elif` and `else` tags to create more complex conditional logic.
