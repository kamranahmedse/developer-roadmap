# Deployment

Deployment is the process of making your Django project accessible to users on the internet. This involves transferring your code, database, and other assets to a server, configuring the server to run your application, and ensuring that it can handle incoming requests. It's the final step in the development lifecycle, allowing users to interact with your Django application.
