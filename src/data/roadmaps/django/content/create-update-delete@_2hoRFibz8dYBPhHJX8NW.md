# Create, Update, Delete Operations in Django ORM

The Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) provides a high-level interface for interacting with databases. It allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your database tables using Python code instead of writing raw SQL queries. This simplifies database interactions and makes your code more maintainable.
