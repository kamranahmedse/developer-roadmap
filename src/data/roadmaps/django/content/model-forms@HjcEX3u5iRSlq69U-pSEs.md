# Model Form Validation

ModelForm validation in Django involves ensuring that the data entered into a form, which is directly tied to a Django model, meets specific criteria before it's saved to the database. This process includes checking data types, lengths, and any custom validation rules defined in the model or the form itself, guaranteeing data integrity and preventing errors.
