# Aggregations

Aggregations in Django allow you to summarize data from your database tables. Instead of retrieving individual records, you can calculate values like averages, sums, minimums, maximums, and counts across a set of records. This is useful for generating reports, statistics, and other summary information directly from your database queries.
