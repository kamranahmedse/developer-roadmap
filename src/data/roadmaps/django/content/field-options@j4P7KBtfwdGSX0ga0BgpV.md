# Field Options in Django Models

Field options are attributes you can define within a Django model's field to control its behavior and characteristics. These options allow you to specify constraints, default values, validation rules, and other metadata for each field, influencing how data is stored, displayed, and handled within your application. They provide a way to customize the fields to meet the specific requirements of your data and application logic.
