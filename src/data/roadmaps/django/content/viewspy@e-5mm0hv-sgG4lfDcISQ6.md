# Views

`views.py` is a Python file in a Django app that contains the logic for handling web requests and returning responses. It defines functions or classes, known as "views," that receive HTTP requests, process data (often interacting with models), and render templates to generate HTML responses that are sent back to the user's browser. Essentially, it acts as the intermediary between the user's request and the data/templates needed to fulfill that request.
