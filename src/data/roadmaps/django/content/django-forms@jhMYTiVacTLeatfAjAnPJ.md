# Django Forms Validation

Form validation in Django involves verifying that the data submitted by a user through a form meets specific requirements before it's processed and saved. This ensures data integrity and prevents errors by checking for things like required fields, correct data types, valid ranges, and unique values. Django provides built-in tools and mechanisms to define and execute these validation rules, making it easier to create robust and reliable forms.
