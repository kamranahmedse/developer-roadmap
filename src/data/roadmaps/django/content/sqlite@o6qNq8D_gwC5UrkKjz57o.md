# SQLite in Django

SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. It's embedded directly into the application, meaning it doesn't require a separate server process to operate. This makes it a lightweight and convenient choice for development, testing, and small-scale Django projects.
