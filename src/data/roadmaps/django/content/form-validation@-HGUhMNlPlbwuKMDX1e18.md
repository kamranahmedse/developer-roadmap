# Form Validation

Form validation in Django is the process of ensuring that the data submitted by a user through a form meets specific requirements before it's saved to the database. This involves checking for things like required fields, correct data types (e.g., email address format), minimum or maximum lengths, and other custom rules you define. If the data doesn't pass these checks, Django provides mechanisms to display error messages to the user, prompting them to correct the input.
