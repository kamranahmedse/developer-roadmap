# Model Field Types

Model field types define the kind of data a field in your Django model can hold, such as text, numbers, dates, or relationships to other models. Each field type corresponds to a specific data type in the database and provides built-in validation and form handling. Choosing the right field type is crucial for data integrity and efficient database storage.
