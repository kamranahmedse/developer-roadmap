# For Loop in Django Templates

The `for` tag in Django Template Language (DTL) provides a way to iterate over items in a list or other iterable object within your templates. It allows you to display data dynamically by looping through each item and rendering it according to the template's structure. You can access loop-specific variables like the current iteration number and whether it's the first or last item.
