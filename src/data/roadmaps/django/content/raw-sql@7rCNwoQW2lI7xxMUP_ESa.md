# Raw SQL Queries

Raw SQL queries in Django allow you to bypass the Django ORM and write SQL statements directly. This is useful when you need to optimize performance, access database-specific features not supported by the ORM, or execute complex queries that are difficult to express using the ORM's query API. It provides a way to interact with the database at a lower level, giving you more control over the generated SQL.
