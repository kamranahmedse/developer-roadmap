# Static Files

Static files in web development refer to the unchanging assets that make up the user interface of a website, such as images, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and fonts. These files are served directly to the user's browser without requiring any server-side processing, contributing to the overall look, feel, and functionality of the website.
