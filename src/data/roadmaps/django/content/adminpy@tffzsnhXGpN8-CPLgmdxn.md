# Django's admin.py

`admin.py` is a Python file within a Django app that's responsible for configuring how your models are displayed and managed in Django's automatically generated admin interface. It allows you to register your models, customize their appearance, add search functionality, and define how they can be edited through the admin site. This file essentially bridges the gap between your data models and the user-friendly admin panel.
