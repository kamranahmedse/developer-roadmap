# Customizing Views

Customizing views in Django involves modifying the default behavior of view functions or classes to suit specific application needs. This can include adding extra context data, altering the template used for rendering, or overriding methods in class-based views to change how they handle requests and responses. Customization allows developers to tailor the view logic to precisely match the requirements of different features and functionalities within a Django project.
