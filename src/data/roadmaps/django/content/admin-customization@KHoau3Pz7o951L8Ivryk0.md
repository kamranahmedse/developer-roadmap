# Admin Customization

Admin customization in Django refers to modifying the default appearance and functionality of the Django admin interface. This involves tailoring the admin site to better suit the specific needs of a project, such as changing the display of fields, adding custom actions, or altering the overall layout. Customization allows developers to create a more user-friendly and efficient experience for content managers and administrators.
