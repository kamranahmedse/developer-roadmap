# Running Your Django Project

Running a Django project involves starting a local development server that allows you to view and interact with your web application in a browser. This server listens for incoming requests and serves the appropriate content, enabling you to test and debug your project during development. It's a crucial step in the Django development workflow, allowing you to see your code in action.
