# Django Shell

The Django Shell is an interactive Python interpreter that provides direct access to your Django project's models, database, and settings. It allows you to test code snippets, query data, and perform administrative tasks without needing to run your entire application. It's essentially a command-line environment pre-configured with your Django project's settings and models.
