# Fixtures

Fixtures in Django provide a way to populate your database with initial data, useful for testing, development, or providing a default dataset for your application. They are typically data files (JSON, XML, or YAML) containing serialized data for one or more database tables, allowing you to easily load and unload data into your Django project's database. This ensures a consistent and repeatable database state.
