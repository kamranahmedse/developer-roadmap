# urls.py in Django Apps

In Django, the `urls.py` file within an app is responsible for defining the URL patterns for that specific app. It acts as a table of contents, mapping URL paths to specific views (functions or classes) that handle the corresponding requests. This file essentially tells Django what code to execute when a user visits a particular URL within the app's scope.
