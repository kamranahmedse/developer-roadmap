# Callbacks

Callbacks are methods that get called at certain moments in the lifecycle of an Active Record object. These moments can include creation, updating, deletion, validation, or saving. By using callbacks, you can trigger logic before or after these actions, allowing you to perform tasks like data validation, auditing, or related object updates automatically
