# Advanced Asset Management

You can use advanced asset management techniques to optimize and organize your application's assets (images, stylesheets, JavaScript files) beyond the basic functionality provided by the asset pipeline. This includes strategies like using CDNs for faster delivery, implementing asset versioning for cache busting, precompiling assets for production environments, and employing tools for minification and compression to reduce file sizes and improve performance. It also covers techniques for organizing assets into logical groups and managing dependencies between them.
