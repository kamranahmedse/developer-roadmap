# Engines

Engines are like mini-applications that can be plugged into a larger Rails application. They provide a way to encapsulate specific functionality, such as a blog, a forum, or an e-commerce platform, into a reusable component. This allows developers to create modular and maintainable applications by isolating concerns and promoting code reuse across different projects.
