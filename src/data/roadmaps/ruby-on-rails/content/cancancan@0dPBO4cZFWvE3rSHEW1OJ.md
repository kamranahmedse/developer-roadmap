# CanCanCan

CanCanCan is an authorization library for Ruby on Rails applications that restricts what resources a given user is allowed to access. It provides a simple and declarative way to define abilities, based on the user's role and the resource being accessed. This allows developers to easily manage permissions and ensure that users can only perform actions they are authorized to do.
