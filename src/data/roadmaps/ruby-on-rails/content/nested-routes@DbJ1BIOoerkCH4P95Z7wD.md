# Nested Routes

Nested routes allow you to define hierarchical relationships between resources in your application's URLs. This means you can represent parent-child relationships, such as comments belonging to a specific post, directly in the URL structure. This approach helps to create more organized and intuitive URLs, reflecting the data's relationships and improving the user experience.
