# Routing Constraints

Routing constraints allow you to restrict which routes are matched based on specific criteria. These criteria can include the request's subdomain, IP address, HTTP headers, or any other attribute of the request. By adding constraints, you can create more precise and targeted routes, ensuring that requests are handled by the correct controller action.
