# MariaDB Support in Rails

MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is a popular fork of MySQL. Rails applications can connect to and interact with MariaDB databases using the `mysql2` adapter. This allows developers to leverage MariaDB's features, such as enhanced performance and storage engines, within their Rails applications for data persistence and management.
