# Hotwire

Hotwire is an alternative approach to building modern web applications by sending HTML over the wire, instead of complex JSON APIs. It allows you to build rich, dynamic user interfaces without writing large amounts of JavaScript. By leveraging server-rendered HTML and a lightweight JavaScript framework, Hotwire simplifies the development process and improves performance.
