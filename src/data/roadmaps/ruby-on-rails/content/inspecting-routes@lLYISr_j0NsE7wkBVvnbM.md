# Inspecting Routes

Rails comes with functionalities that allow developers to view all defined routes, their corresponding HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), the controller and action they map to, and any route parameters. This is crucial for understanding how URLs are handled within the application and for debugging routing issues. Rails provides tools to easily list and analyze these routes, offering insights into the application's URL structure.
