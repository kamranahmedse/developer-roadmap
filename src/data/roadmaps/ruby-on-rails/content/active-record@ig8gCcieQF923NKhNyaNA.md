# Active Record

Active Record is the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer within Ruby on Rails. It acts as an interface between your Ruby code and the database. Instead of writing raw SQL queries, you use Active Record's methods to interact with your database tables as if they were Ruby objects. This allows you to create, read, update, and delete data in a more intuitive and object-oriented way, simplifying database interactions within your Rails application.
