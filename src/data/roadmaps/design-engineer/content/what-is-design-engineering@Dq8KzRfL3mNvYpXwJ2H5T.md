# What is Design Engineering?

Design Engineering is a hybrid discipline that bridges the gap between design and frontend development. Design Engineers are not "designers who code" or "developers with good taste"—they are professionals who are native to both worlds, with deep expertise in crafting polished, production-ready user interfaces.

Design Engineers obsess over the details that make interfaces feel alive: micro-interactions, transitions, loading states, and the subtle polish that distinguishes exceptional products. They think in systems, building reusable components and design tokens that scale across products.

Key characteristics of Design Engineers:

- **Systems Thinkers**: Build reusable, accessible component systems
- **Detail Obsessed**: Care about hover states, transitions, and micro-interactions
- **Technically Skilled**: Write production-quality React, TypeScript, and CSS
- **Design Literate**: Understand visual design principles and can work directly with Figma
- **User Advocates**: Prioritize accessibility and user experience
