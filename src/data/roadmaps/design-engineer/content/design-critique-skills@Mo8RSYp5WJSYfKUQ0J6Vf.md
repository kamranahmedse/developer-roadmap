# Design Critique Skills

Design Engineers must effectively analyze designs, provide constructive feedback, and propose improvements. This skill is assessed in interviews and essential for daily collaboration.

**How to Critique**:

1. **Understand Intent**: What problem is the design solving? Who is it for? What are the constraints?

2. **Identify Strengths**: Start with what works. This isn't just politeness—it shows you recognize good solutions.

3. **Analyze Issues**: Be specific. "This feels crowded" → "The 8px gap between these cards makes them feel cramped; 16px would improve scanability."

4. **Propose Solutions**: Don't just identify problems—suggest alternatives. Consider technical feasibility.

5. **Prioritize Feedback**: Not everything needs to change. What's critical vs. nice-to-have?

**Areas to Evaluate**:
- Visual hierarchy and information flow
- Consistency with design system
- Accessibility concerns
- Responsive behavior
- Edge cases (long text, empty states, errors)
- Technical implementation complexity

**Communication**:
- Frame feedback constructively
- Explain rationale, not just opinion
- Offer alternatives, not just criticism
- Be collaborative, not prescriptive
