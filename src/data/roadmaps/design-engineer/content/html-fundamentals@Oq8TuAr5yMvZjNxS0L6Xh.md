# HTML Fundamentals

HTML is the foundation of every web interface. For Design Engineers, semantic HTML isn't just about structure—it's about accessibility, SEO, and creating a solid foundation for styling and interactivity.

Focus on understanding document structure, semantic elements (header, nav, main, article, section, aside, footer), forms and inputs, and how HTML communicates meaning to browsers and assistive technologies.

As a Design Engineer, you'll use semantic HTML to ensure your beautiful interfaces are also accessible and meaningful. The right HTML element choice affects keyboard navigation, screen reader announcements, and search engine understanding.
