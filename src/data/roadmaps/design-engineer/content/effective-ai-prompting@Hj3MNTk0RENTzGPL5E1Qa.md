# Effective AI Prompting

The quality of AI output directly correlates with prompt quality. Learning to write effective prompts is becoming as important as learning to write code.

**Prompt Structure**:
1. **Context**: What you're building, tech stack, constraints
2. **Task**: Specific action you want the AI to take
3. **Format**: How you want the output structured
4. **Examples**: Show what good output looks like

**For UI Development**:
```
Create a React component for a notification toast.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Include variants: success, error, warning, info
- Support a dismiss button
- Animate entrance/exit with Framer Motion
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns
```

**Iteration Tips**:
- Start broad, then refine with follow-up prompts
- Point out specific issues for correction
- Ask for explanations to understand the code
- Request alternatives to explore options

**What to Include**:
- Design system constraints (spacing scale, colors)
- Accessibility requirements
- Performance considerations
- Specific libraries/patterns to use

**Anti-patterns**:
- Vague requests ("make it better")
- Accepting output without understanding
- Not providing context about your codebase
