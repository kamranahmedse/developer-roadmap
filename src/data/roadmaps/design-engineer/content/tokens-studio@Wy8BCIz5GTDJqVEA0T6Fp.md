# Tokens Studio for Figma

Tokens Studio (formerly Figma Tokens) is a Figma plugin that manages design tokens directly in Figma, syncing them with code repositories. It bridges the gap between design tools and code.

**Key Features**:
- Define and manage tokens in Figma
- Apply tokens to Figma elements
- Sync tokens with GitHub/GitLab
- Export to Style Dictionary format
- Support for token aliases and math

**Token Types Supported**:
- Colors (with opacity support)
- Typography (composite tokens)
- Spacing and sizing
- Border radius
- Shadows
- Composition tokens

**Workflow**:
1. Define tokens in Tokens Studio
2. Apply tokens to Figma designs
3. Push changes to Git repository
4. CI/CD transforms tokens via Style Dictionary
5. Generated files used in codebase

**Why It Matters for Design Engineers**:
- Single source of truth for design decisions
- Designers and developers use same token values
- Changes propagate from design to code
- Version control for design tokens

**Pricing**: Free tier available; paid plans for team features and sync capabilities.
