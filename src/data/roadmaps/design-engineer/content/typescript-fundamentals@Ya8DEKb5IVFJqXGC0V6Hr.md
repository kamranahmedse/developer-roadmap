# TypeScript Fundamentals

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, catching errors at compile time and dramatically improving the development experience. It's required for professional Design Engineer roles.

Core concepts include type annotations, interfaces vs types, union and intersection types, generics, and type inference. TypeScript makes your component APIs self-documenting and catches prop errors before they reach users.

For Design Engineers, TypeScript is essential for building robust component libraries and design systems. It enforces contracts between components, ensures design token usage is correct, and provides excellent IDE autocomplete that speeds up development.

Start with basic types and let TypeScript infer what it can. Add explicit types for function parameters, component props, and public APIs. Don't over-type internal implementation details.
