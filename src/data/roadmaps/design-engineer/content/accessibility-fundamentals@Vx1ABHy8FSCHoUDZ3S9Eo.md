# Accessibility Fundamentals

Accessibility (a11y) ensures interfaces work for everyone, including people with disabilities. For Design Engineers, accessibility isn't an afterthought—it's a core skill that influences every component you build.

**WCAG Guidelines**: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines define standards. Level AA is the typical target. Four principles (POUR):
- **Perceivable**: Users must be able to perceive content
- **Operable**: Users must be able to interact
- **Understandable**: Content must be understandable
- **Robust**: Content must work with assistive technologies

**Key Areas**:
- **Semantic HTML**: Use correct elements (button, not div)
- **Keyboard navigation**: Everything reachable and operable via keyboard
- **Color contrast**: 4.5:1 minimum for normal text
- **Focus management**: Visible focus indicators, logical focus order
- **Screen reader support**: Meaningful labels and announcements

**Design Engineer Responsibility**: Build accessible components from the start. It's much harder to retrofit accessibility than to bake it in.
