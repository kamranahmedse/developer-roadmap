# Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that has become the industry standard for Design Engineers. Its approach—composing small, single-purpose classes—eliminates naming decisions and dead CSS while enabling rapid UI development.

Core concepts include utility classes (flex, pt-4, text-center), responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:), state variants (hover:, focus:, dark:), and configuration via tailwind.config.js.

**Why Tailwind for Design Engineers**: Tailwind's design constraints (spacing scale, color palette, typography scale) encourage consistency. The utility approach maps directly to design tokens. And the speed of styling directly in markup accelerates prototyping.

**Configuration**: tailwind.config.js is where you define your design system—custom colors, spacing, fonts, and breakpoints. This file is your design token source of truth in code.

**With React**: Class composition works naturally with component composition. Tools like CVA (Class Variance Authority) manage variant classes elegantly.
