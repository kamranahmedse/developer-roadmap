# Design Engineer vs Frontend vs UX

Understanding how Design Engineering relates to adjacent roles helps clarify the unique value proposition of this discipline.

**Frontend Developer**: Focuses primarily on implementing features, handling data, managing state, and ensuring application functionality. May work from detailed specifications without deep involvement in visual design decisions.

**UX Designer**: Focuses on user research, information architecture, wireframing, and defining user flows. Typically works in design tools and hands off to developers for implementation.

**Design Engineer**: Bridges both worlds. Implements designs with pixel-perfect precision while contributing to design decisions. Owns the "feel" of interactions—animations, transitions, and micro-interactions. Often works directly in code to prototype and refine designs.

The Design Engineer role emerged because the handoff between design and development often loses fidelity. Design Engineers eliminate this gap by being fluent in both languages.
