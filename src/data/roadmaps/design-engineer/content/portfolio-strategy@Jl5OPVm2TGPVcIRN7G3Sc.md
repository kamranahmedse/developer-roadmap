# Portfolio Strategy

Your portfolio is your most important career asset as a Design Engineer. It demonstrates technical skill, design sensibility, and attention to detail—the core DE competencies.

**Portfolio Site Requirements**:
- **Technical excellence**: Fast (90+ Lighthouse), accessible, responsive
- **Design quality**: Shows you understand visual design principles
- **Modern stack**: Next.js/React, TypeScript, Tailwind—demonstrates current skills
- **Thoughtful details**: Animations, micro-interactions, dark mode

**Content Strategy**:
- Clear positioning statement—what you do, who you help
- 3-5 detailed case studies (quality over quantity)
- About section with personality
- Easy contact method

**What Makes DE Portfolios Different**:
- Interactive elements that showcase animation skills
- Attention to details like loading states, transitions
- Design system thinking visible in consistent patterns
- Technical depth alongside visual polish

**Common Mistakes**:
- Template sites with no customization
- Too many projects with shallow coverage
- No case studies explaining process
- Poor performance/accessibility (ironic for a DE)
