# React Fundamentals

React is the dominant UI library for Design Engineers. Its component-based architecture aligns perfectly with design system thinking, and its ecosystem includes the best animation and styling tools.

Core concepts include function components, JSX syntax, props and children, and component composition. React's declarative approach lets you describe what the UI should look like, and React handles the DOM updates.

For Design Engineers, React enables building reusable component systems, managing complex UI state, and integrating with animation libraries like Framer Motion. The component model mirrors how designers think about UI—as composable, reusable pieces.

Focus on understanding the React mental model, not just the syntax. Components are functions that return UI. Props flow down. State triggers re-renders. This foundation makes everything else click.
