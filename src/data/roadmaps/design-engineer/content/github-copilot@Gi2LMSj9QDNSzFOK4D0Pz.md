# GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot provides AI-powered code completion directly in your editor. It suggests code as you type, helping with boilerplate, common patterns, and repetitive tasks.

**How It Works**:
- Analyzes your code context (current file, open tabs)
- Suggests completions as you type
- Accept with Tab, reject by continuing to type
- Trigger suggestions with comments describing what you want

**Effective for Design Engineers**:
- Tailwind class combinations
- React component boilerplate
- TypeScript type definitions
- Repetitive prop spreading
- Test scaffolding

**Best Practices**:
- Write descriptive comments to guide suggestions
- Always read and understand suggestions before accepting
- Don't rely on it for complex logic
- Use it for acceleration, maintain understanding

**Limitations**:
- May suggest outdated patterns
- Doesn't understand your design system tokens
- Can introduce subtle bugs
- Not a substitute for learning fundamentals

**Integration**: Works in VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains IDEs, and others. Part of GitHub's ecosystem with chat and PR features.
