# Working with Designers

Effective collaboration with designers is a core competency for Design Engineers. Unlike traditional developer-designer handoffs, Design Engineers partner closely with designers throughout the process.

**Understanding Design Intent**: Look beyond the pixels to understand the "why" behind design decisions. Ask about the user problem being solved, not just the visual treatment.

**Speaking the Language**: Learn design terminology—hierarchy, negative space, visual weight, color theory. This shared vocabulary accelerates collaboration.

**Providing Technical Feedback**: Proactively identify implementation challenges and propose alternatives that maintain design intent while being technically feasible.

**Iterating in Code**: Sometimes the best way to refine a design is to build it. Use code prototypes to explore interactions that are hard to express in static mockups.

**Respecting Craft**: Designers care deeply about details. Honor their work by implementing designs faithfully, and discuss any deviations before making them.
