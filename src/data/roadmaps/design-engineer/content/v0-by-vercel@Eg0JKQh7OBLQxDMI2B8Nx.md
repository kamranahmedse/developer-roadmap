v0 is Vercel's AI-powered UI generation tool that creates React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui code from text descriptions or images. It's an excellent prototyping tool for Design Engineers.

**What v0 Does**:
- Generates React components from natural language descriptions
- Converts design screenshots into code
- Produces Tailwind CSS styling with shadcn/ui components
- Offers one-click deployment to Vercel

**Best Use Cases**:
- Rapid prototyping and exploration
- Starting points for custom components
- Converting design mockups quickly
- Learning patterns and implementations

**Limitations to Understand**:
- Output requires refinement for production
- May not match your exact design system tokens
- Accessibility may need manual verification
- Complex interactions often need rework

**Workflow Tips**:
- Be specific in prompts about styling, spacing, behavior
- Iterate on generated code rather than expecting perfection
- Use as inspiration, not final implementation
- Always review and understand the code before committing
