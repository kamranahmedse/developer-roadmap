# shadcn/ui

shadcn/ui is a collection of beautifully designed, accessible components built on Radix primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS. Unlike traditional component libraries, you copy the code directly into your project—it's not a dependency.

**Key Differentiator**: You own the code. Components are copied into your project, fully customizable without fighting library internals. Perfect for design systems that need customization.

**Built On**:
- Radix UI Primitives (accessibility)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- CVA (Class Variance Authority for variants)
- TypeScript

**Installation**:
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

**Why Design Engineers Love It**:
- Excellent defaults that are easy to customize
- Proper accessibility out of the box
- Great starting point for custom design systems
- Components you can learn from and modify
- Active community and frequent updates

**Components Available**: Button, Card, Dialog, Dropdown, Input, Select, Tabs, Toast, and 40+ more components.
