# Visual Hierarchy

Visual hierarchy guides users through content by establishing clear importance levels. It's how you answer the question "what should users see first?"

**Size**: Larger elements attract more attention. Use size to indicate importance—headlines bigger than body text, primary buttons bigger than secondary.

**Color and Contrast**: High contrast draws the eye. Use color strategically to highlight important elements. Reduce contrast for less important content.

**Weight**: Bold text stands out from regular weight. Use sparingly for emphasis without creating visual noise.

**Position**: Elements at the top and left (in LTR languages) are seen first. Place most important content in these prime positions.

**Whitespace**: Space around elements increases their perceived importance. Give key elements room to breathe.

**Gestalt Principles**: Proximity groups related items. Similarity connects elements that look alike. Alignment creates order and relationships.

Users scan in F or Z patterns. Design for scanning, not reading. Make key information discoverable at a glance.
