# Typography Fundamentals

Typography is one of the most powerful tools for creating hierarchy, improving readability, and establishing brand identity. Design Engineers must understand both the principles and the implementation.

**Hierarchy**: Use size, weight, and color to guide readers through content. Headlines large and bold, body text readable, captions small and light.

**Type Scale**: Use a consistent scale (often based on ratios like 1.25 or 1.333) for harmonious sizing. Tools like Utopia help create fluid type scales.

**Line Height**: Body text needs 1.5-1.7 line-height for readability. Headings can be tighter (1.1-1.3).

**Font Pairing**: Limit to 2-3 fonts. Common strategies: serif + sans-serif, or different weights of one family.

**Implementation**: Use rem units for font sizes (accessibility), CSS custom properties for type tokens, and clamp() for fluid typography that scales smoothly without breakpoints.
