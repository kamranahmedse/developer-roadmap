# CSS Fundamentals

CSS is the Design Engineer's primary creative tool. Beyond basic styling, CSS enables the visual polish, animations, and responsive layouts that define exceptional interfaces.

Core concepts include selectors and specificity, the box model, colors and units, typography properties, Flexbox and Grid layouts, responsive design with media queries, and CSS custom properties (variables).

As a Design Engineer, you'll push CSS further than most developers—mastering advanced selectors, creating fluid typography with clamp(), building responsive layouts without media queries, and using modern features like container queries and logical properties.
