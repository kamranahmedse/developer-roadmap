# JavaScript Fundamentals

JavaScript brings interactivity to interfaces. Design Engineers use JavaScript (and TypeScript) to create dynamic components, handle user interactions, manage state, and orchestrate animations.

Core concepts include variables and data types, functions and arrow functions, arrays and objects, destructuring and spread operators, DOM manipulation, event handling, async/await, and ES6+ features like modules and optional chaining.

As a Design Engineer, JavaScript enables you to build interactive components, create smooth animations with libraries like Framer Motion, and handle the complex state management that powers modern UIs.
