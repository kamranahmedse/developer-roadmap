# Design System Fundamentals

A design system is more than a component library—it's a collection of reusable components, design tokens, patterns, and guidelines that ensure consistency across products. Design Engineers are often key contributors to or builders of design systems.

**What's Included**:
- **Design Tokens**: Colors, typography, spacing, shadows
- **Components**: Buttons, inputs, cards, modals, etc.
- **Patterns**: Common UI solutions (forms, navigation, data display)
- **Documentation**: Usage guidelines, do's and don'ts
- **Principles**: Design philosophy guiding decisions

**Why Design Systems Matter**:
- Consistency across products and teams
- Faster development through reuse
- Single source of truth for design decisions
- Accessibility baked in once, used everywhere

**Atomic Design**: Brad Frost's methodology organizes components in levels—atoms (button), molecules (search bar), organisms (header), templates, pages. This mental model helps structure component architecture.
