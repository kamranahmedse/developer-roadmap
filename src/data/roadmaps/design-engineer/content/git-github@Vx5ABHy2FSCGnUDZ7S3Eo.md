# Git and GitHub

Version control is essential for any professional development work. Git tracks changes to your code, and GitHub enables collaboration, code review, and open source contribution.

Core Git skills include: init, add, commit, push, pull for basic workflow; branching and merging for feature development; and understanding the working directory, staging area, and repository.

GitHub extends Git with pull requests for code review, issues for tracking work, and Actions for automation. Understanding GitHub workflow is crucial for working on teams and contributing to open source.

For Design Engineers, Git also tracks design system changes, enables design token versioning, and facilitates collaboration with both designers and developers.
