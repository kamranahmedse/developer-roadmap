# Case Study Writing

Case studies transform projects into compelling narratives that demonstrate your thinking, process, and impact. They're often the deciding factor in hiring decisions.

**Case Study Structure**:

1. **Context**: What was the problem? Who was it for? What were the constraints?

2. **Your Role**: Be specific about YOUR contribution. Hiring managers need to assess individual impact.

3. **Process**: Show your thinking—sketches, iterations, decisions, dead ends. Perfect final outputs don't demonstrate problem-solving.

4. **Solution**: What you built. Include visuals, videos, live demos.

5. **Outcomes**: Quantify impact where possible. What changed? What did you learn?

**Visual Evidence**:
- Before/after comparisons
- Process artifacts (wireframes, explorations)
- Videos of interactions and animations
- Live demos when possible

**Writing Tips**:
- Lead with the problem, not the technology
- Explain why you made specific decisions
- Show trade-offs and constraints
- Be honest about challenges and learnings

**Length**: Deep enough to show thinking (1000-2000 words), scannable enough for busy reviewers. Use visuals liberally.
