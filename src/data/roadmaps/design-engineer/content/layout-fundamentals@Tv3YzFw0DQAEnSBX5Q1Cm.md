# Layout Fundamentals

Layout is how you organize content on screen. Modern CSS provides powerful tools—Flexbox and Grid—that make complex layouts achievable with minimal code.

**Flexbox**: One-dimensional layout (row OR column). Use for component-level layouts: navigation bars, card content, centering elements. Key properties: justify-content, align-items, gap, flex-grow/shrink.

**Grid**: Two-dimensional layout (rows AND columns). Use for page-level layouts and complex component arrangements. Key properties: grid-template-columns/rows, gap, grid-area.

**Spacing Systems**: Use consistent spacing scales (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px). The 8pt grid is industry standard. Tailwind's spacing scale follows this pattern.

**Visual Hierarchy**: Use whitespace, alignment, and proximity to create clear visual hierarchy. Generous whitespace signals quality; cramped layouts feel cheap.

**Responsive Strategy**: Mobile-first approach—start with small screens, add complexity with min-width media queries. Modern CSS (clamp, grid auto-fit) can reduce breakpoint needs.
