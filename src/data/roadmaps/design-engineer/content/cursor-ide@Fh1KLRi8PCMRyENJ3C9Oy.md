# Cursor IDE

Cursor is a VS Code fork with AI deeply integrated into the development experience. It's become a favorite tool for Design Engineers who want AI assistance without leaving their editor.

**Key Features**:
- **Codebase-aware chat**: AI understands your entire project context
- **Composer**: Multi-file editing from natural language instructions
- **Inline editing**: Cmd+K to edit selected code with AI
- **Tab completion**: Intelligent autocomplete beyond GitHub Copilot

**Why Design Engineers Use Cursor**:
- Rapidly prototype component variations
- Refactor styling across multiple files
- Generate boilerplate for new components
- Understand unfamiliar codebases quickly
- Get help with complex TypeScript types

**Effective Usage**:
- Reference specific files in chat (@filename)
- Be precise about what you want changed
- Review all AI suggestions before accepting
- Use for acceleration, not replacement of understanding

**Best Practices**:
- Commit working code before AI-assisted changes
- Understand what the AI generates
- Don't blindly accept multi-file changes
- Use it to learn, not just produce
