# Figma Dev Mode

Dev Mode is Figma's dedicated view for developers, providing precise specifications, code snippets, and asset export tools. It's designed to streamline the design-to-code workflow.

**Inspect Panel**: Shows exact CSS values for selected elements—dimensions, spacing, colors, typography, effects. Copy values directly or extract for your design tokens.

**Code Generation**: Dev Mode generates CSS, iOS, and Android code snippets. Useful as starting points, though you'll often adapt them to your component architecture.

**Measurements**: Hold Option/Alt while hovering to see distances between elements. Essential for accurate spacing implementation.

**Asset Export**: Export images, icons, and graphics at multiple resolutions (1x, 2x, 3x). SVG export for icons is particularly important—prefer SVG for scalable, styleable icons.

**Variables and Styles**: Dev Mode shows which design tokens (variables) are applied to elements. This helps maintain consistency with your design system.

**Annotations**: Designers can add dev-specific notes and annotations visible in Dev Mode.
