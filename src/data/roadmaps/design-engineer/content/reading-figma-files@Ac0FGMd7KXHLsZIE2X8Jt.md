# Reading Figma Files

Figma is the industry-standard design tool, and fluency in reading Figma files is essential for Design Engineers. You need to navigate designs efficiently, extract accurate specifications, and understand designer intent.

**Navigation**: Learn Figma's structure—pages, frames, components, and layers. Use keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl + click for deep selection). Understand how designers organize their files.

**Inspecting Properties**: Dev Mode shows exact CSS values—dimensions, spacing, colors, typography. Learn to extract values accurately and map them to your design tokens.

**Understanding Components**: Figma components have variants for different states (hover, disabled, sizes). Understanding component structure helps you build matching code components.

**Auto Layout**: Figma's auto layout maps to Flexbox. Understanding how designers use auto layout helps you implement layouts correctly.

**What to Look For**: Spacing consistency, color usage patterns, typography hierarchy, component variants, responsive behavior, and interactive states.
