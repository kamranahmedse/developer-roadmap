# Spiral Learning Approach

This roadmap uses spiral learning—a methodology where you revisit core concepts multiple times at increasing depth. Rather than mastering one topic before moving to the next, you build a mental map of everything first, then deepen your understanding with each pass.

**Phase 1 - Foundation (4 weeks)**: Touch all major concepts at surface level. Build your mental map of how everything connects. You won't master anything yet, and that's okay.

**Phase 2 - Building (6 weeks)**: Return to the same topics with more depth. Build real projects that combine multiple concepts. Start to understand "why" not just "how."

**Phase 3 - Professional (8 weeks)**: Advanced patterns and production-quality work. Design systems, complex animations, accessibility mastery. Ready for professional work.

**Phase 4 - Mastery (Ongoing)**: Specialization, portfolio development, and career growth. Continuous learning and refinement.

**Why Spiral Works**: Traditional linear learning leads to forgetting earlier topics while grinding on later ones. Spiral learning reinforces connections and builds deeper understanding through repetition with variation.
