    question: 'What is a Design Engineer?',
    answer: [
      'A Design Engineer is a hybrid professional who bridges the gap between design and frontend development. They are not "designers who code" or "developers with good taste" but professionals who are native to both worlds.',
      'Design Engineers obsess over the details that make interfaces feel alive: micro-interactions, transitions, loading states, and the subtle polish that distinguishes exceptional products. They think in systems, building reusable components and design tokens that scale across products.',
      'This role has gained prominence at companies like Vercel, Linear, and Stripe, where the quality of UI implementation directly impacts product perception.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'How is Design Engineering different from Frontend Development?',
    answer: [
      'While both roles involve building user interfaces, Design Engineers have a distinct focus on the craft and polish of the UI layer.',
      'Frontend developers typically focus on functionality, performance, and application architecture. Design Engineers, on the other hand, prioritize visual fidelity, animation quality, and the "feel" of interactions.',
      'Design Engineers work more closely with design teams, often interpreting and refining designs during implementation. They have strong opinions about typography, spacing, color, and motion that come from design literacy, not just technical knowledge.',
      'Think of it this way: a frontend developer might implement a modal that works correctly, while a Design Engineer ensures the modal feels delightful with perfect animations, focus management, and visual polish.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'What skills do I need to become a Design Engineer?',
    answer: [
      'Design Engineers need a blend of technical and design skills:',
      '**Technical skills**: Strong proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (or similar frameworks), TypeScript, and animation libraries like Framer Motion. Understanding of accessibility, performance, and component architecture.',
      '**Design skills**: Visual design literacy including typography, color theory, layout, and spacing. Ability to read and interpret Figma files, understand design systems, and implement pixel-perfect interfaces.',
      '**Soft skills**: Strong communication with both designers and engineers, attention to detail, and the patience to iterate on subtle visual refinements.',
      'You do not need to be an expert designer or a senior engineer to start. Many Design Engineers develop these skills through practice and building projects that prioritize polish.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'What tools do Design Engineers use?',
    answer: [
      'Design Engineers work with tools from both design and development worlds:',
      '**Design tools**: Figma (especially Dev Mode), design system documentation, and sometimes prototyping tools like Framer.',
      '**Development tools**: VS Code or Cursor, React/Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and component libraries like Radix UI and shadcn/ui.',
      '**Animation tools**: Framer Motion is the de facto standard for React animation. CSS transitions and animations for simpler cases.',
      '**Design system tools**: Storybook for component documentation, Style Dictionary or Tokens Studio for design tokens.',
      '**AI tools**: v0 by Vercel for prototyping, GitHub Copilot or Cursor for code assistance.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to become a Design Engineer?',
    answer: [
      'The timeline varies based on your starting point and learning intensity.',
      'If you are a frontend developer with basic design awareness, you could transition to a Design Engineer role in 3-6 months by focusing on animation, design systems, and visual polish.',
      'If you are a designer learning to code, expect 6-12 months to build sufficient technical proficiency in React, TypeScript, and frontend tooling.',
      'If you are starting from scratch, plan for 12-18 months of dedicated learning, though you could land junior positions earlier.',
      'This roadmap uses a spiral learning approach with four phases: Foundation (4 weeks), Building (6 weeks), Professional (8 weeks), and ongoing Mastery. Each phase revisits core concepts at increasing depth.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'What companies hire Design Engineers?',
    answer: [
      'Design Engineers are in high demand at companies that prioritize product craft and user experience:',
      '**Tech companies**: Vercel, Linear, Stripe, Figma, Notion, Raycast, and other product-focused companies.',
      '**Design agencies**: Fantasy, Work & Co, Instrument, and agencies that create premium digital experiences.',
      '**Startups**: Many well-funded startups hire Design Engineers to establish strong design-engineering culture early.',
      '**In-house teams**: Companies with mature design systems often have Design Engineer roles within their design or platform teams.',
      'The title may vary. Look for roles like "UI Engineer", "Creative Developer", "Frontend Designer", or "Design Technologist" that emphasize both design and engineering skills.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the salary range for Design Engineers?',
    answer: [
      'Design Engineer salaries vary based on location, experience, and company size.',
      'In the United States, salaries typically range from $90,000 to $180,000+ for full-time positions. Senior Design Engineers at top companies like Vercel or Stripe can earn $200,000+ total compensation.',
      'Remote positions often pay competitively, though salaries may be adjusted for location in some companies.',
      'Because the role is relatively new and in high demand, skilled Design Engineers often have strong negotiating power, especially those with impressive portfolios showcasing polished, production-quality work.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to know animation to be a Design Engineer?',
    answer: [
      'Animation is a core skill for Design Engineers, but you do not need to master it before starting.',
      'At a minimum, you should understand CSS transitions and basic animation principles. As you progress, learning Framer Motion becomes essential for creating sophisticated interactions.',
      'Key animation concepts include: easing functions, spring physics, duration guidelines, micro-interactions, and respecting reduced motion preferences for accessibility.',
      'The good news is that animation can be learned incrementally. Start with simple hover states and transitions, then progress to more complex choreographed animations as you build projects.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I learn design tools like Figma?',
    answer: [
      'Yes, fluency in Figma is essential for Design Engineers.',
      'You need to be able to read and interpret design files accurately, extracting exact values for spacing, typography, colors, and effects. Figma Dev Mode is particularly valuable for this workflow.',
      'You do not need to create designs from scratch (though many Design Engineers do), but you should understand design tool concepts like auto-layout, constraints, components, and variants.',
      'Being comfortable in Figma also enables better collaboration with designers and helps you catch design inconsistencies during implementation.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I include in my Design Engineer portfolio?',
    answer: [
      'A Design Engineer portfolio should showcase both technical skill and design sensibility:',
      '**Case studies**: 2-3 detailed writeups showing your process, decisions, and outcomes. Focus on the craft: why you chose specific animations, how you handled edge cases, what tradeoffs you made.',
      '**Interactive demos**: Live examples of components, animations, or micro-interactions. These demonstrate your attention to detail better than screenshots.',
      '**Open source contributions**: Contributions to design systems, component libraries, or tools show community involvement and code quality.',
      '**Personal site**: Your portfolio website itself is a portfolio piece. Make it polished, performant, and thoughtfully designed.',
      'Quality over quantity. Three exceptional projects with deep explanation beat ten mediocre ones.',
    ],
  },
