  title: What is Golang?
  description: |
    Golang is an open-source programming language developed at Google by developers like Rob Pike. As an interesting trivia fact, Golang is often referred to as "the go language".

    The design philosophy behind Golang revolves around the concepts of simplicity, efficiency, and performance, making it a great tool for software development. In fact, Go code is compiled, meaning that it needs to be translated into machine code before execution making it run much faster than scripting/interpreted code.

    As far as programming languages go, Golang comes out of the box with a mature standard library (meaning it's capable of doing pretty much anything you want without needing extra modules) and a clean syntax that focuses on clarity. Golang is designed to provide an efficient programming environment with built-in garbage collection and strong support for concurrent programming, which is essential if you're building complex systems and scalable services.

    ## What is Golang used for?

    Golang is used for backend development and platform programming, especially in scenarios that demand efficiency and scalability.
    Given its design principles, this language is perfect for creating microservices, APIs, and other server-side applications that demand stable operations and proper resource management. The language has a very powerful concurrency model, making it intuitive and well-suited for developing software that can handle large-scale data processing and network operations.

    Companies, especially those based in tech hubs like San Francisco and New York (such as Uber, Dropbox, Trivago and others), use Golang to build scalable and very performant services that integrate well with other technologies and provide the high-performing backend they need. Enabling a smooth process from start to finish.

    ## What does a Go developer do?

    A Go developer creates powerful and scalable backend services using the Go language.

    Their role involves writing, testing, and maintaining code for integration systems (taking information from one system and sending it into another one), building RESTful microservices, and other types of backend (or server-side) solutions.

    They do this by leveraging Golang's unique constructs and features to structure programs effectively. Beyond this, one of the major tasks for Go developers is to focus on optimizing code efficiency, developing K8 operators, and building small dev tools. In other words, short of frontend development, Go devs can build pretty much anything.

    ## What skills does a Go developer need?

    A Go developer needs a deep understanding of both fundamental programming concepts and the unique features of Golang. 
    They should, obviously, be well-versed in the language itself,  managing pointers, as well as understanding how to use its mature standard library.

    An expert Go developer in this field must understand garbage collection and how to optimize code for high performance and scalability given how these are major design pillars for Go.

    On top of that, familiarity with testing frameworks and debugging tools is also essential to ensure that applications are both reliable and efficient. Many companies assess these skills during interviews by asking a variety of [Golang interview questions](https://roadmap.sh/questions/golang) that explore topics like concurrency, data structures, and the integration of Golang with other languages and technologies.

    The role requires a strong foundation in software development practices (i.e. version control, code smells, unit testing, etc) as well as a willingness to continuously learn and adapt to new tools and techniques to survive in the constantly evolving tech environment.
