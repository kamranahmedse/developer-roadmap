# for loop

Go's only looping construct, incredibly flexible for all iteration needs. Classic form: initialization, condition, post statements. Omit components for different behaviors (infinite, while-like). Use with `break`, `continue`, labels for nested loops. `for range` for convenient collection iteration.
