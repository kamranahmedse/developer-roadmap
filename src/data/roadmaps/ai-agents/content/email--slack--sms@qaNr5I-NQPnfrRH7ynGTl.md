# Email / Slack / SMS

Email, Slack, and SMS are message channels an AI agent can use to act on tasks and share updates. The agent writes and sends emails to give detailed reports or collect files. It posts to Slack to chat with a team, answer questions, or trigger alerts inside a workspace. It sends SMS texts for quick notices such as reminders, confirmations, or warnings when a fast response is needed. By picking the right channel, the agent reaches users where they already communicate, makes sure important information arrives on time, and can even gather replies to keep a task moving forward.
