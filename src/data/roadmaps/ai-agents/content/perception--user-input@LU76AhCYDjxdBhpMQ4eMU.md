# Perception / User Input

Perception, also called user input, is the first step in an agent loop. The agent listens and gathers data from the outside world. This data can be text typed by a user, spoken words, camera images, sensor readings, or web content pulled through an API. The goal is to turn raw signals into a clear, usable form. The agent may clean the text, translate speech to text, resize an image, or drop noise from sensor values. Good perception means the agent starts its loop with facts, not guesses. If the input is wrong or unclear, later steps will also fail. So careful handling of perception keeps the whole agent loop on track.
