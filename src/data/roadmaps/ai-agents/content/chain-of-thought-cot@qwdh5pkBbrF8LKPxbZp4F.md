# Chain of Thought (CoT)

Chain of Thought (CoT) is a way for an AI agent to think out loud. Before giving its final answer, the agent writes short notes that show each step it takes. These notes can list facts, name sub-tasks, or do small bits of math. By seeing the steps, the agent stays organized and is less likely to make a mistake. People who read the answer can also check the logic and spot any weak points. The same written steps can be fed back into the agent so it can plan, reflect, or fix itself. Because it is easy to use and boosts trust, CoT is one of the most common designs for language-based agents today.
