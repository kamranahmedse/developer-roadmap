# API Requests

API requests let an AI agent ask another service for data or for an action. The agent builds a short message that follows the service’s rules, sends it over the internet, and waits for a reply. For example, it can call a weather API to get today’s forecast or a payment API to charge a customer. Each request has a method like GET or POST, a URL, and often a small block of JSON with needed details. The service answers with another JSON block that the agent reads and uses. Because API requests are fast and clear, they are a common tool for connecting the agent to many other systems without extra work.
