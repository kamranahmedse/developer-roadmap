# Langchain

LangChain is a Python and JavaScript library that helps you put large language models to work in real products. It gives ready-made parts for common agent tasks such as talking to many tools, keeping short-term memory, and calling an external API when the model needs fresh data. You combine these parts like Lego blocks: pick a model, add a prompt template, chain the steps, then wrap the chain in an “agent” that can choose what step to run next. Built-in connectors link to OpenAI, Hugging Face, vector stores, and SQL databases, so you can search documents or pull company data without writing a lot of glue code. This lets you move fast from idea to working bot, while still letting you swap out parts if your needs change.
