# Standard Analyzer

The Standard Analyzer is a default text analyzer in Elasticsearch that breaks text into individual words based on whitespace and punctuation. It also converts all terms to lowercase and removes common English stop words like "the," "a," and "is." This analyzer is a good general-purpose choice for many text indexing and searching tasks.
