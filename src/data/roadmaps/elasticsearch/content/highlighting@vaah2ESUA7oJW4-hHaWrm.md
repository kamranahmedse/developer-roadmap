# Highlighting

Highlighting in Elasticsearch helps users quickly identify the search terms within the returned documents. It works by surrounding the search keywords in the results with special tags, like `<em>` and `</em>`, making them visually distinct. This allows users to easily see why a particular document matched their query without having to read the entire document. You can customize the tags used for highlighting, the fields that are highlighted, and even the way the highlighting is performed to suit your specific needs.
