# Data Nodes

Data nodes in Elasticsearch are the workhorses of the cluster, responsible for storing data and performing CPU and I/O intensive operations like searching, indexing, and data analysis. These nodes hold shards of Elasticsearch indices and manage the actual data storage on disk. They contribute significantly to the cluster's overall performance and scalability.
