# Dynamic Mappings

Dynamic mapping in Elasticsearch allows the index to automatically detect and add new fields to the mapping when new documents containing previously unseen fields are indexed. This means you don't have to predefine the schema for every field in your data; Elasticsearch infers the data type and adds the field to the index mapping on the fly. This is useful for quickly indexing data without upfront schema design.
