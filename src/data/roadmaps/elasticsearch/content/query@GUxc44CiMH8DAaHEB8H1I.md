# Query

A query is a request for information from a data source. It specifies the criteria for retrieving specific data that matches the defined conditions. In Elasticsearch, queries are used to search and retrieve documents that match certain criteria within an index. These queries can range from simple keyword searches to complex combinations of filters and conditions.
