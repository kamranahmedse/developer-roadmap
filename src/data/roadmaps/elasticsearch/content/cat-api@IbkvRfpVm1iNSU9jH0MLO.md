# CAT API

The CAT API in Elasticsearch provides a simple, human-readable way to access cluster-level information using a command-line interface or a RESTful API. It returns data in a tabular format, making it easy to understand and interpret the status, health, and performance metrics of your Elasticsearch cluster. This API is primarily used for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.
