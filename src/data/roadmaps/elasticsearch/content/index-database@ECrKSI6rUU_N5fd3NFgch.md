# Index (Database)

An index is a collection of documents that have similar characteristics. Think of it as a database in a relational database system. It's where Elasticsearch stores and organizes data, allowing for efficient searching and retrieval. Each index is identified by a name, which is used when performing indexing, searching, updating, and deleting operations.
