# Pagination

Pagination divides search results into discrete pages, allowing users to navigate through large datasets in manageable chunks. Instead of displaying all results at once, which can be overwhelming and resource-intensive, pagination presents a subset of results per page, improving user experience and reducing server load. This involves specifying the starting point (from) and the number of results to return (size) for each page.
