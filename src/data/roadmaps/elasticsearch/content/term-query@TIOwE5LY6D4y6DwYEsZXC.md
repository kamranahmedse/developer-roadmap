# Term Query

A term query is a simple search that looks for documents containing an exact, unanalyzed term in a specific field. It's like searching for a specific word or value without any stemming, synonyms, or other text processing applied. This query is useful when you know the precise value you're looking for and want to find documents that contain it exactly as is.
