# ES|QL

ES|QL is a query language designed for Elasticsearch that allows users to search, transform, and analyze data using a SQL-like syntax. It provides a more familiar and accessible way to interact with Elasticsearch data compared to the traditional JSON-based query DSL, enabling users to perform complex data manipulations and aggregations with relative ease.
