# Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a distributed, open-source search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured. It's built on Apache Lucene and provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. Elasticsearch is commonly used for log analytics, full-text search, security intelligence, business analytics, and operational intelligence use cases.
