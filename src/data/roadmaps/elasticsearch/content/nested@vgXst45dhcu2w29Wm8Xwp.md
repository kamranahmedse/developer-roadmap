# Nested Data Type

The nested data type is used to represent arrays of objects within a document. Each object in the array can be indexed as a separate document, allowing you to query and filter based on the properties of individual objects within the array, without affecting other objects in the same array. This is particularly useful when you need to perform complex queries on related objects stored within a single document.
