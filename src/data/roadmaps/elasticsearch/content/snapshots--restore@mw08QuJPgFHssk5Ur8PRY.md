# Snapshots and Restores

Snapshots are backups of your Elasticsearch cluster's data and state, stored in a repository. Restoring from a snapshot allows you to recover data in case of failure, corruption, or accidental deletion. This mechanism provides a way to revert your cluster to a previous point in time, ensuring data safety and disaster recovery capabilities.
