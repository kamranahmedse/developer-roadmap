# Pivot Transformation

The pivot transformation in Elasticsearch is a way to reshape your data by aggregating values from one or more fields into columns. It essentially rotates the data, turning unique values in a field into separate fields in the output. This allows you to analyze and visualize data in a different format, making it easier to identify trends and patterns that might be hidden in the original structure.
