# Filter

A filter in Elasticsearch is a query that returns documents matching specific criteria in a boolean (yes/no) manner. Unlike regular queries that calculate a relevance score, filters simply determine whether a document matches the condition or not. They are often used to narrow down the search results based on specific attributes or ranges, such as price, date, or category.
