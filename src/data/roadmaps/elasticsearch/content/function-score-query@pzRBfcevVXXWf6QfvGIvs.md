# Function Score Query

The Function Score Query allows you to modify the score of documents retrieved by a query. It provides a way to apply a function to each document that matches the base query, influencing its final relevance score. This function can be based on factors like document fields, pre-defined weights, or even custom scripts, enabling fine-grained control over search results ranking.
