# Rollover Policies

Rollover policies in Elasticsearch automate the management of indices over time. They define conditions, such as index size, document count, or age, that trigger the creation of a new index and the transition of write operations to it. This process helps maintain manageable index sizes, optimize search performance, and simplify data retention strategies.
