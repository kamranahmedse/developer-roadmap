# Cardinality Aggregation

Cardinality aggregation is used to estimate the number of unique values in a field. It's particularly useful when you need to count distinct items but don't need the actual unique values themselves. This aggregation provides an approximate count, balancing accuracy with performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
