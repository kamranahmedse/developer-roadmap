# Must Queries

A "must" query in Elasticsearch is a type of compound query that specifies conditions that documents must satisfy to be included in the search results. It contributes to the relevance score of each matching document. Essentially, it acts as a mandatory filter, ensuring that only documents matching the specified criteria are returned.
