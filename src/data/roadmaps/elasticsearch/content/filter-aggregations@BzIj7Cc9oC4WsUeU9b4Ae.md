# Filter Aggregations

Filter aggregations narrow down the documents that are used to calculate metrics within an aggregation. They work by applying a filter to the documents before the aggregation is performed, effectively creating a subset of the data for analysis. This allows you to focus on specific segments of your data and gain insights into particular subsets of your documents.
