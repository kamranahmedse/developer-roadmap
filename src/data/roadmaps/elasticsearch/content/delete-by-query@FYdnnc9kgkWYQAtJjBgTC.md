# Delete by Query

Delete by Query allows you to remove documents from an Elasticsearch index that match a specific query. Instead of deleting documents individually by their ID, you can define criteria based on field values or other search parameters. This is useful for removing outdated, irrelevant, or incorrect data from your index in bulk.
