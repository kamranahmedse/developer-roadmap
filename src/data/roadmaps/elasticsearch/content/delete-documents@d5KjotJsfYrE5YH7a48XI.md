# Delete Documents

Deleting a document in Elasticsearch involves sending a DELETE request to a specific index and document ID. This action permanently removes the document from the index. After a successful deletion, the document will no longer be searchable. The operation requires specifying the index name and the unique identifier of the document you wish to remove.
