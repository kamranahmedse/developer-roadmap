# Update by Query

Update by Query is a way to update documents that match a specific query. Instead of retrieving each document individually, modifying it, and then re-indexing it, Update by Query allows you to perform updates on multiple documents in a single operation based on a search query. This is particularly useful for making bulk changes to your data based on certain criteria.
