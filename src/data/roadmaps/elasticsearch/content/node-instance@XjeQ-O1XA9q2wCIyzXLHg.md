# Node (Instance)

A node is a single server within an Elasticsearch cluster that stores data and participates in the cluster's indexing and search capabilities. Each node is configured with a name and can be assigned specific roles, such as master, data, or ingest, to optimize resource allocation and cluster performance. Nodes communicate with each other to distribute data, manage cluster state, and handle search requests.
