# Latest Transformation

The "latest" transformation in Elasticsearch is used to identify and extract the most recent document within a group of documents that share a common field value. It allows you to find the most up-to-date information for each unique entity based on a specified sorting criteria, such as a timestamp or version number. This is particularly useful when dealing with time-series data or scenarios where you need to retrieve the latest state of an object.
