# Cluster (System)

A cluster is a collection of one or more Elasticsearch nodes that work together to store and process data. It provides a distributed and scalable system where data is divided into shards and distributed across multiple nodes for redundancy and performance. The cluster manages indexing, searching, and analysis operations across all nodes, presenting a unified view of the data to the user.
