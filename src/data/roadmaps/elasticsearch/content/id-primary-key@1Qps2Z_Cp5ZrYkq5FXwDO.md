# ID (Primary Key)

An ID, or Primary Key, is a unique identifier for each document stored within an Elasticsearch index. It distinguishes one document from another, allowing for specific retrieval, updating, and deletion of individual data entries. This unique identifier is crucial for maintaining data integrity and enabling efficient data management within the Elasticsearch system.
