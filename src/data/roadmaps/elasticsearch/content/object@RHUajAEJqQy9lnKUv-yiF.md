# Object Data Type

An object is a data type that allows you to store nested JSON documents within a single document. This means you can represent complex, hierarchical data structures where a field can contain other fields and their corresponding values, similar to how objects are structured in programming languages. These nested objects can be indexed and searched, enabling you to query based on the properties within the nested structure.
