# Master-Eligible Nodes

Master-eligible nodes in Elasticsearch are the nodes that can be elected as the master node. The master node is responsible for cluster-wide management tasks, such as creating or deleting indices, tracking which nodes are part of the cluster, and deciding how to allocate shards across the cluster. These nodes participate in the master election process and have the potential to become the cluster's central controller.
