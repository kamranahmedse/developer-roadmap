# Geo Points

Geo points are a specific data type in Elasticsearch used to store and index latitude and longitude coordinates. They allow you to represent locations on Earth and perform geospatial queries, such as finding points within a certain distance of a location or identifying points within a defined area. These coordinates are typically stored as a pair of numbers, with latitude representing the north-south position and longitude representing the east-west position.
