# Wildcard Query

A wildcard query lets you search for terms that match a specified pattern. This pattern can include special characters like `*` (representing zero or more characters) and `?` (representing any single character). It's a way to perform flexible text searches when you don't know the exact term you're looking for, allowing you to find variations or partial matches within your data.
