# Mappings

Mappings are like schemas in relational databases; they define how a document and its fields are stored and indexed. They specify the data type of each field (like text, keyword, date, or number) and how Elasticsearch should handle that data for searching and analysis. Mappings are crucial for ensuring data is indexed correctly and that queries return accurate and relevant results.
