# Avg, Sum, Min, and Max Aggregations

These aggregations are fundamental tools for calculating statistical summaries of numerical data.  They compute the average (Avg), total (Sum), smallest value (Min), and largest value (Max) respectively, across a set of documents that match a query. These aggregations operate on numeric fields within your Elasticsearch indices, providing insights into the distribution and range of your data.
