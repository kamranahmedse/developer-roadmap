# Value Count Aggregation

Value Count is a type of metric aggregation that calculates the total number of values present in a specific field. It essentially counts how many documents have a value for the chosen field, including duplicates if they exist. This aggregation is useful for determining the overall occurrence or frequency of a particular field within your dataset.
