# Histogram Aggregation

A histogram aggregation calculates the distribution of numeric values across a set of intervals, or "buckets." It groups data into these buckets based on their values, providing a count of how many data points fall within each bucket's range. This allows you to visualize the frequency of values within specific ranges, revealing patterns and trends in your data.
