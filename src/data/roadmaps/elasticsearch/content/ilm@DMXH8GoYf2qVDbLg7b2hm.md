# Index Lifecycle Management (ILM)

Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) automates the process of managing Elasticsearch indices over time. It defines policies to control how indices are stored, moved, and deleted based on factors like age, size, or performance. This helps optimize resource utilization, reduce storage costs, and ensure data is available when needed.
