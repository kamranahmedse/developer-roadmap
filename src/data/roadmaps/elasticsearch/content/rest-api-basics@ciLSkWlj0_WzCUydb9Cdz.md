# REST API Basics

REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for building networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol, typically HTTP, to perform operations on resources. These operations, often referred to as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), are executed using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, allowing different software systems to interact with each other over a network.
