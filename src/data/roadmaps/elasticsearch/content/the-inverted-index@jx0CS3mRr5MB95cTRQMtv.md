# The Inverted Index

The inverted index is a data structure that stores a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to their locations in a document or a set of documents. Instead of listing documents and then the words they contain, an inverted index lists words and then the documents in which those words appear. This allows for very fast full-text searches.
