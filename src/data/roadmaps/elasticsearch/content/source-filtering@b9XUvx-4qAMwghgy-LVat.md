# Source Filtering

Source filtering in Elasticsearch allows you to control which fields are returned in the `_source` field of your search results. Instead of retrieving the entire document, you can specify which fields you need, reducing network traffic and improving performance. This is achieved by including or excluding specific fields based on patterns or exact names.
