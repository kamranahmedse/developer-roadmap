# JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It's based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language, and uses a text-based format to represent data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs and array data types. JSON is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page) and is a standard format for APIs and configuration files.
