# Segment Merging

Segment merging is the process of combining multiple smaller segments in an Elasticsearch index into larger segments. This optimization reduces the number of segments the search engine needs to consult during a query, leading to faster search performance and more efficient resource utilization. The process involves reading the data from the smaller segments, merging them, and writing the merged data into a new, larger segment.
