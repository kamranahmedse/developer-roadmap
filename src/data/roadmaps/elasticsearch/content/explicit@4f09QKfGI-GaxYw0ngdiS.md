# Explicit Mappings

Explicit mappings in Elasticsearch involve defining the structure and data types of fields within an index before indexing any documents. This allows you to have precise control over how Elasticsearch analyzes and stores your data, ensuring that fields are treated as intended (e.g., a field containing dates is treated as a date, not just text). By explicitly defining mappings, you can optimize search performance and data integrity.
