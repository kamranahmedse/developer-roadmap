# Query DSL

Query DSL (Domain Specific Language) is a JSON-based language used to define and execute search queries in Elasticsearch. It provides a structured way to express complex search criteria, including boolean logic, term matching, range queries, and more, allowing users to precisely specify what data they want to retrieve.
