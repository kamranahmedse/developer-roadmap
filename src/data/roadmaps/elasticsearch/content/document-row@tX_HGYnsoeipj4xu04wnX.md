# Document (Row)

A document is a basic unit of information in Elasticsearch, analogous to a row in a relational database table. It's a JSON object containing a set of fields, each with a name and one or more values. These fields can hold various data types like text, numbers, dates, booleans, and even nested objects or arrays.
