# SLM

Snapshot Lifecycle Management (SLM) provides a way to automate the creation, retention, and deletion of Elasticsearch snapshots. It allows you to define policies that specify when snapshots should be taken, how long they should be kept, and how they should be named, ensuring consistent and reliable backups of your Elasticsearch data.
