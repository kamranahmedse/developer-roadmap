# Running Elasticsearch with Docker

Docker provides a convenient and isolated environment to run applications, including Elasticsearch. Using Docker, you can quickly set up an Elasticsearch instance without worrying about operating system compatibility or dependency conflicts. This involves pulling the official Elasticsearch image from a registry like Docker Hub, configuring the necessary environment variables and port mappings, and then starting the container. This approach simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across different environments.
