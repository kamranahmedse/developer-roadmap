# Must_Not Queries

`must_not` is a clause within a `bool` query that filters out documents matching the specified query. It defines conditions that documents should *not* satisfy to be included in the search results. Essentially, it excludes documents that would otherwise be considered relevant based on other clauses in the `bool` query.
