# Reindex API

The Reindex API in Elasticsearch allows you to copy documents from one index to another. This is useful for a variety of tasks, including changing the mapping of an index, upgrading to a new Elasticsearch version, or splitting a large index into smaller ones. It essentially reads documents from a source index and writes them into a destination index, optionally applying transformations along the way.
