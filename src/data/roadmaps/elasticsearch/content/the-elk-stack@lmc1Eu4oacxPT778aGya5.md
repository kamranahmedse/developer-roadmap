# The ELK Stack

The ELK Stack is a collection of three open-source projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine. Logstash is a data processing pipeline that ingests data from various sources, transforms it, and then feeds it into Elasticsearch. Kibana lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch. Together, they form a powerful solution for log management, security analytics, and observability.
