# Estimate and Evaluate

Estimation and evaluation are critical skills for architects and lead developers. Architects must understand basic project management principles to provide estimates for timelines, resources, and costs, considering all project phases like requirements, testing, and debugging. Using past data or models like COCOMO helps refine estimates. For agile projects, resources like *"Agile Estimating and Planning"* by Mike Cohn can offer valuable guidance. 

Evaluating "unknown" architectures involves assessing their suitability for current and future contexts through prepared questions. These should cover design practices (e.g., patterns and structure), development practices (e.g., code guidelines and deployment), quality assurance (e.g., test automation and peer reviews), and security measures (e.g., built-in security and penetration tests). This structured approach ensures informed decisions and promotes robust, maintainable solutions.
