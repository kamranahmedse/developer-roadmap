# Simplifying Things

Simplifying solutions is critical for effective problem-solving, aligning with Occam’s Razor, which favors simplicity by reducing unnecessary assumptions. To achieve this, “shake” your solution by analyzing it from different perspectives and questioning its assumptions. After complex discussions, take a step back to review the big picture and refactor if needed, giving your brain time to process ideas. Apply the *divide and conquer* method to break problems into smaller parts and validate their integration afterward. Finally, remember that refactoring is a valuable process to improve overly complex solutions, provided there’s adequate test coverage and stakeholder support.
