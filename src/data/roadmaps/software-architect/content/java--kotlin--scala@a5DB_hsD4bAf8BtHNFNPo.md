# Java/Kotlin/Scala

*   **Java**: Java is a widely-used, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence, reliability, and scalability. It’s commonly used for building large-scale enterprise applications, Android development, and web services. Java’s extensive libraries, frameworks, and strong community support make it a popular choice for developers.
    
*   **Scala**: Scala is a statically-typed programming language that combines object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is known for its concise syntax, expressive power, and compatibility with Java. Scala is often used in data engineering, backend services, and applications requiring high concurrency.
    
*   **Kotlin**: Kotlin is a modern, statically-typed programming language designed to be fully interoperable with Java while offering more concise and expressive syntax. It is particularly popular for Android development due to its simplicity and safety features, such as null safety, and is gaining traction in backend development as well.
