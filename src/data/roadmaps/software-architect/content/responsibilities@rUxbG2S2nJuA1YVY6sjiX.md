# Architect Responsibilities

To understand the necessary skills an architect needs, we first need to understand typical activities. The following list contains from my perspective the most important activities:

*   Define and decide development technology and platform
*   Define development standards, e.g., coding standards, tools, review processes, test approach, etc.
*   Support identifying and understanding business requirements
*   Design systems and take decisions based on requirements
*   Document and communicate architectural definitions, design and decisions
*   Check and review architecture and code, e.g., check if defined patterns and coding standards are implemented properly
*   Collaborate with other architects and stakeholders
*   Coach and consult developers
*   Make sure that as implementation takes place, the architecture is being adhered to
*   Play a key part in reviewing code
*   Detail out and refine higher level design into lower level design
