# RUP

The RUP (**Rational Unified Process**) is not a widely recognized certification like PMP or Scrum, but rather a software development framework created by Rational Software (now IBM). It follows an iterative and incremental approach to project development, based on best practices for delivering high-quality software on time and within budget.
