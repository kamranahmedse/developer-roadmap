# Service oriented

Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an enterprise-wide approach to software development of application components that takes advantage of reusable software components, or services.

SOA provides four different service types:

1. Functional services (i.e., business services), which are critical for business applications.
2. Enterprise services, which serve to implement functionality.
3. Application services, which are used to develop and deploy apps.
4. Infrastructure services, which are instrumental for backend processes like security and authentication.
