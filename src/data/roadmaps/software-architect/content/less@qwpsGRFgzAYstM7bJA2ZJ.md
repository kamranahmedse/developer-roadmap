# Less

**LeSS** (Large-Scale-Scrum) is an agile framework designed to scale Scrum across multiple teams working on a single product. It adheres to Scrum's principles, emphasizing simplicity and continuous improvement. LeSS encourages coordination between teams by using a single backlog and a common Product Owner. Each team is responsible for parts of the product, but they collaborate in its joint development, with frequent feedback loops to adjust project direction. Its goal is to minimize bureaucracy and maximize value delivery in an agile and efficient way.
