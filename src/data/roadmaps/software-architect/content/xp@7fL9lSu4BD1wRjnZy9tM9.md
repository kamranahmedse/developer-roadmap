# Extreme Programming (XP)

`Extreme Programming (XP)` is a popular agile software development framework that emphasizes speed, simplicity, and quality. It was developed by Kent Beck in the late 1990s and is based on five values:

*   **Communication**: Open and honest communication among team members and stakeholders is essential.
*   **Simplicity**: The simplest solution that works is always preferred.
*   **Feedback**: Continuous feedback from customers and team members is used to improve the product.
*   **Courage**: Team members must be willing to make changes and take risks.
*   **Respect**: Everyone on the team is treated with respect.
