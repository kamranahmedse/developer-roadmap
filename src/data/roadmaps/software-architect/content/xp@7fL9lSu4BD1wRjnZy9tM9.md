- **Communication**: Open and honest communication among team members and stakeholders is essential.
- **Simplicity**: The simplest solution that works is always preferred.
- **Feedback**: Continuous feedback from customers and team members is used to improve the product.
- **Courage**: Team members must be willing to make changes and take risks.
