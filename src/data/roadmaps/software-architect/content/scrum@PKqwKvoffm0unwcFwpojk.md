# Scrum

`Scrum` is a popular agile framework used for project management, particularly in software development. It emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility to deliver high-quality products.

Key elements of Scrum:

*   **Sprints**: Time-boxed iterations (usually 2-4 weeks) where teams work on specific goals.
*   **Product Backlog**: Prioritized list of features or requirements for the product.
*   **Sprint Backlog**: Selected items from the Product Backlog to be completed during a Sprint.
*   **Daily Scrum (Stand-up)**: Brief daily meeting where team members share progress, challenges, and plans for the day.
*   **Sprint Review**: Meeting at the end of a Sprint to demonstrate completed work and gather feedback.
*   **Sprint Retrospective**: Meeting to reflect on the Sprint, identify improvements, and adjust processes for the next Sprint.
