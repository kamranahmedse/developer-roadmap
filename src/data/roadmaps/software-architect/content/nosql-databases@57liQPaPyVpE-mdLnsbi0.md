# Nosql databases

NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

Types of NoSQL databases

- Document databases Ex. MongoDB
- Key-value databases Ex. Redis
- Wide-column databases Ex. Cassandra
