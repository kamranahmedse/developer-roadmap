# SAFe

**SAFe** is an agile framework designed to scale agile practices in large and complex organizations. Unlike LeSS, SAFe is more structured and provides a formal approach to coordinating multiple teams, programs, and portfolios. It incorporates elements of `Lean`, `DevOps`, and `agile principles`, and defines additional roles, ceremonies, and artifacts to align teams' goals with the business strategy. SAFe enables **large-scale planning**, **continuous delivery**, and **improvement of organizational efficiency**, offering a comprehensive framework for agile transformation at the corporate level.
