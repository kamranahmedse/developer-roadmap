# ETL Datawarehouses

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a key process in data warehousing, enabling the integration of data from multiple sources into a centralized database. The process begins by **extracting** data from original sources, followed by **transforming** it to ensure quality, deduplication, and combination, and finally **loading** it into the target database. ETL tools streamline this process, allowing companies to consolidate diverse data types and ensure seamless integration for effective data analysis and decision-making.
