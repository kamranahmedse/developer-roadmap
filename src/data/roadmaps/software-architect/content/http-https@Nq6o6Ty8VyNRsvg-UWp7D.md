# Http Https

HTTP is the `TCP/IP` based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. It defines how the content is requested and transmitted across the internet.

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website.

`HTTPS = HTTP + SSL/TLS`
