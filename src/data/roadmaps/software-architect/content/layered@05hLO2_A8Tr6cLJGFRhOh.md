# Layered Architecture

Layered architecture is a software design pattern where an application is divided into distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility, such as presentation, business logic, and data access. This approach promotes modularity, easier maintenance, testing, and component reusability. The most common implementation is the three-tier architecture, which separates concerns between the user interface, business rules, and data handling. However, it can introduce complexity, performance issues, tight coupling, and overhead if not carefully implemented. Despite these challenges, layered architecture is widely used in scalable and maintainable systems, particularly in enterprise applications.
