# Firewalls

A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. Firewalls usually sit between a trusted network and an untrusted network; oftentimes the untrusted network is the Internet. For example, office networks often use a firewall to protect their network from online threats.
