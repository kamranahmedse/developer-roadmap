# GitHub

GitHub has become a central hub for open-source projects and is widely used by developers, companies, and organizations for both private and public repositories. It was acquired by Microsoft in 2018 but continues to operate as a relatively independent entity. GitHub's popularity has made it an essential tool in modern software development workflows and a key platform for showcasing coding projects and contributing to open-source software.
