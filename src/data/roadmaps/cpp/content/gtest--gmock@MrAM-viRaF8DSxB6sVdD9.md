# Google Test and Google Mock

Google Test and Google Mock are open-source C++ unit testing frameworks developed by Google. Google Test is a standalone framework for writing and running unit tests, while Google Mock extends it with powerful mocking capabilities. GMock is especially useful for testing components that interact with external or third-party utilities.
