# CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of web pages, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user experience. CSS allows developers to separate content from presentation, making websites easier to maintain and update.
