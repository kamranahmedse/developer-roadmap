# AI-Powered Code Reviews

AI-powered code reviews leverage machine learning models to analyze source code and identify potential issues, such as bugs, security vulnerabilities, code style violations, and performance bottlenecks. These tools can automate parts of the code review process, freeing up developers to focus on more complex problems and improving the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase.
