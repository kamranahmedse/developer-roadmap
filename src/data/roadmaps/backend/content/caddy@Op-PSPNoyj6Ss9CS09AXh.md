# Caddy

Caddy is a modern, open-source web server written in Go. It's known for its simplicity, automatic HTTPS encryption, and HTTP/2 support out of the box. Caddy stands out for its ease of use, with a simple configuration syntax and the ability to serve static files with zero configuration. It automatically obtains and renews SSL/TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt, making secure deployments straightforward. Caddy supports various plugins and modules for extended functionality, including reverse proxying, load balancing, and dynamic virtual hosting. It's designed with security in mind, implementing modern web standards by default. While it may not match the raw performance of servers like Nginx in extremely high-load scenarios, Caddy's simplicity, built-in security features, and low resource usage make it an attractive choice for many web hosting needs, particularly for smaller to medium-sized projects or developers seeking a hassle-free server setup.
