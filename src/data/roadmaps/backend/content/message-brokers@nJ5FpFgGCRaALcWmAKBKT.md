# Message Brokers

Message brokers are intermediaries that facilitate communication between distributed systems or components by receiving, routing, and delivering messages. They enable asynchronous message passing, decoupling producers (senders) from consumers (receivers), which improves scalability and flexibility. Common functions of message brokers include message queuing, load balancing, and ensuring reliable message delivery through features like persistence and acknowledgment. Popular message brokers include Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and ActiveMQ, each offering different features and capabilities suited to various use cases like real-time data processing, event streaming, or task management.
