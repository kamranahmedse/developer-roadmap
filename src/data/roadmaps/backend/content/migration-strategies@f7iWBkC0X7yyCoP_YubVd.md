# Migration Strategies

Migration strategies involve planning and executing the transition of applications, data, or infrastructure from one environment to another, such as from on-premises systems to the cloud or between different cloud providers. Key strategies include:

1. **Rehost (Lift and Shift)**: Moving applications as-is to the new environment with minimal changes, which is often the quickest but may not fully leverage new platform benefits.
2. **Replatform**: Making some optimizations or changes to adapt applications for the new environment, enhancing performance or scalability while retaining most of the existing architecture.
3. **Refactor**: Redesigning and modifying applications to optimize for the new environment, often taking advantage of new features and improving functionality or performance.
4. **Repurchase**: Replacing existing applications with new, often cloud-based, solutions that better meet current needs.
5. **Retain**: Keeping certain applications or systems in their current environment due to specific constraints or requirements.
6. **Retire**: Decommissioning applications that are no longer needed or are redundant.

Each strategy has its own trade-offs in terms of cost, complexity, and benefits, and the choice depends on factors like the application’s architecture, business needs, and resource availability.
