# ScyllaDB

ScyllaDB is a NoSQL database designed for high performance and low latency. It's built to be compatible with Apache Cassandra, meaning it uses the CQL (Cassandra Query Language) and offers similar data modeling capabilities. However, ScyllaDB is written in C++ and optimized for modern hardware, aiming to provide significantly better throughput and resource utilization compared to Cassandra.
