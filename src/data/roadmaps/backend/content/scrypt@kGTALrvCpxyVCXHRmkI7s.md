# Scrypt

scrypt is a memory-hard key derivation function designed to resist brute-force and hardware-based attacks (GPUs, ASICs). Combines hash functions with high memory usage and CPU-intensive computation, making large-scale attacks costly and impractical. Used for secure password storage and cryptocurrency mining.
