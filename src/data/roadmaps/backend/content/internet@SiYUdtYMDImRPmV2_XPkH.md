Backend development focuses on the server-side logic of a web application, handling data storage, processing, and security. It involves building and maintaining the infrastructure that powers the user-facing frontend, ensuring seamless communication between the client and the database. This includes tasks like creating APIs, managing databases, and implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
