# Bitbucket

Bitbucket is a web-based version control repository hosting service owned by Atlassian. It primarily uses Git version control systems, offering both cloud-hosted and self-hosted options. Bitbucket provides features such as pull requests for code review, branch permissions, and inline commenting on code. It integrates seamlessly with other Atlassian products like Jira and Trello, making it popular among teams already using Atlassian tools. Bitbucket supports continuous integration and deployment through Bitbucket Pipelines. It offers unlimited private repositories for small teams, making it cost-effective for smaller organizations. While similar to GitHub in many aspects, Bitbucket's integration with Atlassian's ecosystem and its pricing model for private repositories are key differentiators. It's widely used for collaborative software development, particularly in enterprise environments already invested in Atlassian's suite of products.
