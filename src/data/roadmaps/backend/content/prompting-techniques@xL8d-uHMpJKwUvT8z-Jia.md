# Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective inputs (prompts) to guide AI models to generate desired outputs. It involves strategically designing prompts to optimize the model’s performance by providing clear instructions, context, and examples. Effective prompt engineering can improve the quality, relevance, and accuracy of responses, making it essential for applications like chatbots, content generation, and automated support. By refining prompts, developers can better control the model’s behavior, reduce ambiguity, and achieve more consistent results, enhancing the overall effectiveness of AI-driven systems.
