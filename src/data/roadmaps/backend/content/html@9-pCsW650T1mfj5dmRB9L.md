# HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a website by using elements, which are defined by tags, to organize text, images, and other multimedia. Browsers interpret HTML files to render the visual representation of a webpage that users see.
