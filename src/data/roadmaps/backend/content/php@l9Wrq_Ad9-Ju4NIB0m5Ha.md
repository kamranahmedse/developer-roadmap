PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used, open-source scripting language designed primarily for web development but also applicable for general-purpose programming. It is embedded within HTML to create dynamic web pages and interact with databases, often working with MySQL or other database systems. PHP is known for its simplicity, ease of integration with various web servers, and extensive support for web-related functionalities. Its wide adoption is driven by its role in powering major platforms and content management systems like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. PHP's features include server-side scripting, session management, and support for various web protocols and formats.
