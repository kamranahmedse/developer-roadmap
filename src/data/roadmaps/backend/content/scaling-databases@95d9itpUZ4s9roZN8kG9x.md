# Scaling Databases

Scaling databases is the process of adapting them to handle more data and users efficiently. It's achieved by either upgrading existing hardware (vertical scaling) or adding more servers (horizontal scaling). Techniques like sharding and replication are key. This ensures databases continue to be a robust asset as they grow.
