# TimeScale

TimescaleDB is an open-source, time-series database built as an extension to PostgreSQL. It is designed to handle large volumes of time-stamped data efficiently, making it suitable for applications that require high-performance analytics on time-series data, such as monitoring systems, IoT applications, and financial services. TimescaleDB leverages PostgreSQL’s features while providing additional capabilities for time-series data, including efficient data ingestion, advanced time-based queries, and automatic data partitioning (hypertables). It supports complex queries and aggregations, making it a powerful tool for analyzing trends and patterns in time-series data.
