# Integration Patterns

Integration patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems when connecting different software systems or applications. They provide a structured approach for ensuring data is correctly exchanged, services are seamlessly accessed, and overall system behavior is predictable and reliable when integrating AI-powered functionalities. This allows developers to handle complexities like data transformations, error handling, security, and message routing in a standardized way.
