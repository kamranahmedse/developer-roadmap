# Refactoring with AI

Refactoring, in the context of software development, is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing its internal structure—without changing its external behavior. AI tools can assist in this process by analyzing code for potential improvements in readability, performance, and maintainability. They can automatically suggest or even implement changes like simplifying complex logic, removing redundant code, and improving code style consistency, ultimately leading to a cleaner and more efficient codebase.
