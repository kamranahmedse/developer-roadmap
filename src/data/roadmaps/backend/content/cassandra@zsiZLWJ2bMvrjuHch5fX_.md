# Cassandra

Cassandra is a NoSQL database designed for handling large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. It uses a distributed architecture to achieve scalability and fault tolerance, making it suitable for applications that require continuous uptime and can tolerate eventual consistency. Data is organized into tables with rows and columns, similar to relational databases, but with a more flexible schema.
