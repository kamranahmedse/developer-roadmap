# N plus one problem

The N+1 problem occurs when an application retrieves a list then performs additional queries for each item's related data. Results in inefficient query multiplication (1 + N queries instead of optimized joins). Severely impacts performance with larger datasets. Solved through query optimization, joins, or batching techniques.
