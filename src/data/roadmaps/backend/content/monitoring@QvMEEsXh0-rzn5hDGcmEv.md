# Monitoring

Monitoring involves continuously collecting, analyzing, and alerting on metrics, logs, and traces from applications and infrastructure. It helps detect issues early, understand performance bottlenecks, and ensure system reliability. Key tools include Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for dashboards and visualization, and distributed tracing tools like Jaeger or Zipkin.
