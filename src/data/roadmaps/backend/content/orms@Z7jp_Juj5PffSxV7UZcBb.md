# ORMs

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) allows developers to interact with databases using object-oriented concepts. Maps database tables to classes and rows to objects, eliminating raw SQL queries. Simplifies data manipulation and improves maintainability. Popular ORMs: Hibernate (Java), Entity Framework (.NET), SQLAlchemy (Python).
