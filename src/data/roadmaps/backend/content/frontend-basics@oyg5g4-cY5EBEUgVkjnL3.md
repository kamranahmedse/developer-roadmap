Frontend basics encompass the core technologies and principles used to build the user interface of a web application. This includes HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling and visual presentation, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for backend developers to effectively collaborate with frontend teams, design APIs that cater to frontend needs, and troubleshoot issues that may arise between the client and server sides.
