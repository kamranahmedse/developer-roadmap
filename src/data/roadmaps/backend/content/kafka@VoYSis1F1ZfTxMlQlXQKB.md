# Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant data processing. It acts as a message broker, allowing systems to publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a distributed commit log. Kafka is highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data with low latency, making it ideal for real-time analytics, log aggregation, and data integration. It features topics for organizing data streams, partitions for parallel processing, and replication for fault tolerance, enabling reliable and efficient handling of large-scale data flows across distributed systems.
Kafka Streams is a powerful, lightweight Java library designed for building real-time, scalable, and fault-tolerant stream processing applications on top of Apache Kafka. It enables developers to process and analyze data stored in Kafka topics by providing a simple API for writing stream transformations, aggregations, joins, and more. Kafka Streams abstracts away much of the complexity involved in handling distributed systems, offering stateful processing, windowing, and exactly-once processing guarantees out of the box. This makes it ideal for use cases like event-driven microservices, real-time analytics, monitoring, and ETL pipelines.
