JavaScript is a programming language primarily used to add interactivity to websites. It allows developers to create dynamic content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more, enhancing the user experience beyond static HTML and CSS. While often associated with front-end development, JavaScript can also be used on the back-end with technologies like Node.js.
