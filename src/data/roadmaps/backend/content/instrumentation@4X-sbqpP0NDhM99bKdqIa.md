# Instrumentation, Monitoring, and Telemetry

Instrumentation, monitoring, and telemetry are critical components for ensuring system reliability and performance. *Instrumentation* refers to embedding code or tools within applications to capture key metrics, logs, and traces. *Monitoring* involves observing these metrics in real time to detect anomalies, failures, or performance issues, often using dashboards and alerting systems. *Telemetry* is the automated collection and transmission of this data from distributed systems, enabling visibility into system behavior. Together, these practices provide insights into the health, usage, and performance of systems, aiding in proactive issue resolution and optimizing overall system efficiency.
