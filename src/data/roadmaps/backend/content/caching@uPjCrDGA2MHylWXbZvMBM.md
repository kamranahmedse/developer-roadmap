# Caching

Caching is a technique used to store copies of data in a temporary storage location so that future requests for that data can be served faster. This temporary storage, known as a cache, can be located closer to the request source than the original data source, reducing latency and improving application performance. By retrieving data from the cache instead of the original source, applications can respond more quickly and efficiently.
