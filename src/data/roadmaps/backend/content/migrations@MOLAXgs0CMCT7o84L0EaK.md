# Database Migrations

Database migrations are structured scripts that incrementally update a database schema to a new version. They provide a controlled and repeatable way to evolve the database structure as an application changes, ensuring data integrity and consistency across different environments. These scripts typically include instructions for creating, altering, or deleting tables, columns, indexes, and other database objects.
