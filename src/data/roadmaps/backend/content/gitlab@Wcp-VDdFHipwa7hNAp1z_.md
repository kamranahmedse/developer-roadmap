# GitLab

GitLab is a web-based DevOps platform that provides a complete solution for the software development lifecycle. It offers source code management, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), issue tracking, and more, all integrated into a single application. GitLab supports Git repositories and includes features like merge requests (similar to GitHub's pull requests), wiki pages, and issue boards. It emphasizes DevOps practices, providing built-in CI/CD pipelines, container registry, and Kubernetes integration. GitLab offers both cloud-hosted and self-hosted options, giving organizations flexibility in deployment. Its all-in-one approach differentiates it from competitors, as it includes features that might require multiple tools in other ecosystems. GitLab's focus on the entire DevOps lifecycle, from planning to monitoring, makes it popular among enterprises and teams seeking a unified platform for their development workflows.
