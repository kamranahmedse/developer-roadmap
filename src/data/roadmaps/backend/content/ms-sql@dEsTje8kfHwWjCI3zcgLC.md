# MS SQL

Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL) is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft for managing and storing structured data. It supports a wide range of data operations, including querying, transaction management, and data warehousing. SQL Server provides tools and features for database design, performance optimization, and security, including support for complex queries through T-SQL (Transact-SQL), data integration with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and business intelligence with SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). It is commonly used in enterprise environments for applications requiring reliable data storage, transaction processing, and reporting.
