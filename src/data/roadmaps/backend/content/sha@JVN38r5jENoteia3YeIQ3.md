# SHA family

SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is a family of cryptographic hash functions generating fixed-size hash values for data integrity and security. Includes SHA-1 (weak, 160-bit), SHA-2 (stronger, 224-512 bits), and SHA-3 (latest with additional security features). Used for password storage and digital signatures.
