# Antigravity

Antigravity is an AI-powered code completion tool designed to enhance developer productivity. It learns from your coding style and project context to provide intelligent suggestions, autocompletions, and code generation snippets directly within your integrated development environment (IDE). This allows developers to write code faster and more efficiently, reducing errors and streamlining the development process.
