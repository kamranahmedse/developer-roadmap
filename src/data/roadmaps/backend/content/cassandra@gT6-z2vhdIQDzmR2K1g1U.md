# Cassandra

Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large amounts of structured data across multiple commodity servers. It provides high availability with no single point of failure, offering linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure. Cassandra uses a masterless ring architecture, where all nodes are equal, allowing for easy data distribution and replication. It supports flexible data models and can handle both unstructured and structured data. Cassandra excels in write-heavy environments and is particularly suitable for applications requiring high throughput and low latency. Its data model is based on wide column stores, offering a more complex structure than key-value stores. Widely used in big data applications, Cassandra is known for its ability to handle massive datasets while maintaining performance and reliability.
