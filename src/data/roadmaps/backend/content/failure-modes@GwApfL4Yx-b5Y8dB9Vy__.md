# Failure Modes

Database failure modes refer to the various ways in which a database system can malfunction or cease to operate correctly. These include hardware failures (like disk crashes or network outages), software bugs, data corruption, performance degradation due to overload, and inconsistencies in distributed systems. Common failure modes involve data loss, system unavailability, replication lag in distributed databases, and deadlocks. To mitigate these, databases employ strategies such as redundancy, regular backups, transaction logging, and failover mechanisms. Understanding potential failure modes is crucial for designing robust database systems with high availability and data integrity. It informs the implementation of fault tolerance measures, recovery procedures, and monitoring systems to ensure database reliability and minimize downtime in critical applications.
