# ACID

ACID represents four database transaction properties: Atomicity (all-or-nothing execution), Consistency (valid state maintenance), Isolation (concurrent transaction separation), and Durability (permanent commit survival). These principles ensure reliable data processing and integrity in database systems, crucial for financial and e-commerce applications.
