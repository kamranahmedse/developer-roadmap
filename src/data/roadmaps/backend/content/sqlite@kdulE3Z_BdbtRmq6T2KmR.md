# SQLite

SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine that is designed for simplicity and efficiency. It is widely used in embedded systems and applications where a full-featured database server is not required, such as mobile apps, desktop applications, and small to medium-sized websites. SQLite stores data in a single file, which makes it easy to deploy and manage. It supports standard SQL queries and provides ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance to ensure data integrity. SQLite’s small footprint, minimal configuration, and ease of use make it a popular choice for applications needing a compact, high-performance database solution.
