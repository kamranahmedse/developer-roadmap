# Benefits over Objective-C

**Safety and Reliability:** Swift includes features like optionals and type inference that reduce common programming errors and crashes.

**Modern Syntax:** Swift’s concise and clean syntax improves readability and maintainability.

**Performance:** Swift is designed for speed and efficiency, often outperforming Objective-C in benchmarks.

**Interoperability:** Swift can easily coexist with Objective-C, allowing for a gradual transition of codebases.

**Memory Management:** Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) in Swift handles memory management across both procedural and object-oriented code, reducing memory leaks.

**Playgrounds:** Swift's interactive playgrounds provide a dynamic environment for testing and learning Swift code.
