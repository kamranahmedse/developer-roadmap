# Navigation View
A view for presenting a stack of views that represents a visible path in a navigation hierarchy.
Use a NavigationView to create a navigation-based app in which the user can traverse a collection of views. Users navigate to a destination view by selecting a NavigationLink that you provide. On iPadOS and macOS, the destination content appears in the next column. Other platforms push a new view onto the stack, and enable removing items from the stack with platform-specific controls, like a Back button or a swipe gesture.
> [!WARNING]
> Deprecated. Use NavigationStack and NavigationSplitView instead. For more information, see Migrating to new navigation types.
