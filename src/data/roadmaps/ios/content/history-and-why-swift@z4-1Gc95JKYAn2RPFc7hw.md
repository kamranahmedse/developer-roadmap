# History and Why Swift?

**History**

Swift was introduced by Apple in 2014 as a modern replacement for Objective-C. 

It was developed to address the limitations and complexities of Objective-C, providing a more powerful and user-friendly programming language.

**Why Swift?**

Swift offers improved performance, safety, and readability. It reduces common programming errors with features like optionals and type inference. 

Swift’s concise syntax and modern language constructs enhance developer productivity, making it easier to write and maintain code. Its open-source nature also allows a wider community to contribute and improve the language.
