# OOP

Object-Oriented Programming **(OOP)** is a style where code is organized around "objects," which are instances of classes combining data and methods. It emphasizes encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling modular, reusable, and maintainable code. OOP allows developers to model real-world entities and their interactions, making complex software design more intuitive and efficient.
