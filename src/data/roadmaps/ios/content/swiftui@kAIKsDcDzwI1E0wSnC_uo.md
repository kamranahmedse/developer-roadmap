# SwiftUI

SwiftUI is Apple's modern declarative framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms. Introduced in 2019, it allows developers to create UIs using Swift code, describing the desired layout and behavior rather than implementing them imperatively. SwiftUI offers a more concise and intuitive approach to UI development, with features like automatic support for Dark Mode, dynamic type, and localization. It uses a state-driven approach, automatically updating the UI when underlying data changes. While newer than UIKit, SwiftUI is rapidly evolving and gaining adoption, offering seamless integration with UIKit when needed.
