# Azure Functions

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service in Microsoft Azure that enables developers to run event-triggered code without managing infrastructure. It supports multiple programming languages and integrates seamlessly with other Azure services, allowing for scalable, on-demand execution of small, focused pieces of code. Azure Functions automatically scales based on demand, charges only for actual compute time used, and can be triggered by various events such as HTTP requests, timers, or changes in cloud services, making it ideal for microservices, data processing, and workflow automation tasks.
