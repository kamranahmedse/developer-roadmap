# Networking Tools

Networking tools are essential software utilities used for monitoring, analyzing, troubleshooting, and managing computer networks. They include a wide range of applications such as Wireshark for deep packet analysis, Nmap for network scanning and security auditing, Ping for testing basic connectivity, Traceroute for visualizing network paths, Netstat for displaying network connections, Tcpdump for command-line packet capture, Iperf for performance testing, Netcat for various network operations, Nslookup/Dig for DNS queries, and PuTTY for remote access via SSH or telnet. These tools collectively enable network administrators and security professionals to diagnose issues, optimize performance, conduct security assessments, and maintain the overall health and efficiency of network infrastructures, ranging from small local networks to large-scale enterprise environments.
