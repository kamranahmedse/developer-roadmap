# Bash Scripts

Bash scripts are a type of shell script that uses the Bash shell command language. Bash, which stands for "Bourne-Again SHell", is a Unix shell and command-line interpreter written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project.

A Bash script is a text file that contains a series of commands that are executed in order when the script is run. These commands can be a combination of Bash built-in commands, external commands, and shell functions. Bash scripts are typically used to automate repetitive tasks, simplify complex commands, and perform system administration tasks.

Bash scripts usually have a .sh extension and are executable files. To run a Bash script, you need to give it execute permissions using the chmod command, and then you can run it by typing `./script_name.sh` in the terminal.
