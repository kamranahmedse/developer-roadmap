# OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. These layers, from bottom to top, are: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. Each layer serves a specific purpose in the process of data communication, with lower layers handling more hardware-oriented tasks and upper layers dealing with software and user-interface aspects. The model helps in understanding how data moves through a network, troubleshooting network issues, and designing network protocols and hardware. While not strictly adhered to in real-world implementations, the OSI model remains a valuable educational tool and reference point for network engineers and developers, providing a common language for discussing network operations and architecture.
