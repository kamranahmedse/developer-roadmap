# SOPS

SOPS (Secrets OPerationS) is an open-source tool for securely storing and managing secrets, such as passwords, API keys, and other sensitive information. It is developed and maintained by Mozilla and is available as a command-line tool and as a library for integration into other applications.

SOPS is designed to be easy to use and highly secure, with a range of features for managing secrets, including:

- Encryption: SOPS uses encryption algorithms and protocols, such as AES and RSA, to securely store secrets.
- Access controls: SOPS supports role-based access controls and multi-factor authentication to ensure that only authorized users or systems can access secrets.
- Secret rotation: SOPS supports automatic secret rotation, allowing secrets to be regularly rotated to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
- Auditing: SOPS provides auditing capabilities, allowing administrators to track and monitor access to secrets.

SOPS is commonly used in DevOps environments to securely store and manage secrets, and it is often used in conjunction with other tools, such as Kubernetes and Helm, to automate the deployment and management of cloud-native applications.
