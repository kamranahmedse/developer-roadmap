# Pulumi

Pulumi is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) platform that allows developers to define and manage cloud resources using familiar programming languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, and .NET languages. It supports multiple cloud providers including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes. Pulumi's approach enables developers to use standard programming constructs such as loops, functions, and classes to create reusable and modular infrastructure code. It provides a unified workflow for deploying and managing resources across different cloud environments, offering features like state management, drift detection, and preview of changes before deployment. Pulumi's ecosystem includes a registry of pre-built components and integrations with CI/CD systems, making it a powerful tool for teams adopting DevOps practices and managing complex, multi-cloud infrastructures.
