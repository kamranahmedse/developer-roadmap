# Puppet

Puppet is an open-source configuration management tool that automates the provisioning, configuration, and management of servers and applications across infrastructure. It uses a declarative, model-based approach where administrators define the desired state of systems using Puppet's domain-specific language or Ruby. Puppet agents running on managed nodes periodically check with a central Puppet server, applying necessary changes to reach the defined state. This ensures consistency across environments and facilitates scalable infrastructure management. Puppet supports a wide range of operating systems and cloud platforms, offering modules for common services and applications. With features like reporting, role-based access control, and integration with other DevOps tools, Puppet helps organizations implement infrastructure as code, enforce compliance, and streamline IT operations across diverse and complex environments.
