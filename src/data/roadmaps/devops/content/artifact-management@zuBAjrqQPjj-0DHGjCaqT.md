# Artifacts

In software development, artifacts are various outputs produced throughout the development lifecycle, including source code, binaries, documentation, configuration files, build outputs, and test results. These artifacts are essential for managing, deploying, and maintaining applications, as they provide the necessary resources and documentation for development, testing, and production environments. They help track the progress of a project, ensure consistency, and facilitate the efficient delivery and operation of software systems.
