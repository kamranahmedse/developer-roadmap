# FreeBSD

FreeBSD is a free, open-source Unix-like operating system descended from the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). Known for its stability, performance, and advanced networking capabilities, FreeBSD is popular for server environments, embedded systems, and as a basis for network appliances. It features a monolithic kernel, a comprehensive set of userland utilities, and a ports collection for easy software installation. FreeBSD supports a wide range of architectures and includes advanced features like the ZFS file system, jails for containerization, and the pf packet filter. While less common in desktop environments, it's widely used in internet infrastructure, storage systems, and by companies requiring a robust, customizable OS with a permissive license.
