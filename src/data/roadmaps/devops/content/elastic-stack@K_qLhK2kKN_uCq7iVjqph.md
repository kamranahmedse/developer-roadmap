# Elastic Stack

The Elastic Stack, formerly known as ELK Stack, is a set of open-source tools for searching, analyzing, and visualizing data in real-time. It consists of four main components: Elasticsearch (a distributed search and analytics engine), Logstash (a data processing pipeline), Kibana (a data visualization and management tool), and Beats (lightweight data shippers). Together, these tools enable users to collect data from various sources, process and enrich it, store it in a searchable format, and create interactive visualizations and dashboards. The Elastic Stack is widely used for log analytics, application performance monitoring, security information and event management (SIEM), and business intelligence applications, offering scalability and flexibility for handling large volumes of diverse data.
