# Containers

Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that package applications and their dependencies, enabling consistent deployment across different computing environments. They encapsulate software code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings, ensuring that the application runs the same regardless of where it's deployed. Containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them more efficient than traditional virtual machines. Popular containerization platforms like Docker provide tools for creating, distributing, and running containers. This technology supports microservices architectures, simplifies application deployment, improves scalability, and enhances DevOps practices by streamlining the development-to-production pipeline and enabling more efficient resource utilization.
