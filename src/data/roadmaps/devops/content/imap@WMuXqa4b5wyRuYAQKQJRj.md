# IMAP

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a standard email protocol that allows email clients to access messages stored on a mail server. Unlike POP3, IMAP keeps emails on the server, enabling access from multiple devices while maintaining synchronization. It supports folder structures, message flagging, and partial message retrieval, making it efficient for managing large volumes of emails. IMAP allows users to search server-side, reducing bandwidth usage. It's designed for long-term mail storage on the server, ideal for users who need to access their email from various devices or locations. IMAP's synchronization capabilities and server-side management features make it the preferred protocol for most modern email systems, especially in mobile and multi-device environments.
