# Rust

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on safety, concurrency, and performance. Developed by Mozilla Research, Rust combines low-level control over system resources with high-level abstractions, preventing common programming errors like null or dangling pointer references at compile-time. It features a borrow checker for managing memory and preventing data races, making it ideal for building reliable and efficient software. Rust's zero-cost abstractions, pattern matching, and trait-based generics offer powerful tools for expressing complex ideas clearly. While primarily used for systems programming, web assembly, and game development, Rust's growing ecosystem supports various domains. Its emphasis on memory safety without sacrificing performance makes it increasingly popular for developing secure, high-performance applications in fields ranging from operating systems to web services.
