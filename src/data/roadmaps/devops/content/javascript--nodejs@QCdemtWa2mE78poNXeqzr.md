# JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for client-side web development. It enables interactive and dynamic content on web pages, allowing developers to create responsive user interfaces and complex web applications. JavaScript is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming paradigms. With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript has also become popular for server-side development. The language features dynamic typing, first-class functions, and prototype-based object-orientation. JavaScript's ubiquity in web browsers, extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (like React, Angular, and Vue.js), and its versatility across front-end and back-end development have made it one of the most widely used programming languages in modern software development.
