# SOPS

SOPS (Secrets OPerationS) is an open-source tool for managing and encrypting sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and certificates. It allows developers to store secrets securely in version-controlled files by encrypting specific parts of files, typically using AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault, or PGP. SOPS integrates seamlessly with infrastructure-as-code workflows, ensuring that secrets remain secure throughout the development lifecycle while allowing decryption only in trusted environments. It strikes a balance between security and usability in secret management.
