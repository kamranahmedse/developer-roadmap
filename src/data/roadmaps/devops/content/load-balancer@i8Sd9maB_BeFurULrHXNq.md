# Load Balancer

Load Balancer acts as the **traffic cop** sitting in front of your servers and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures that no one server is overworked. If one of the servers goes down, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining online servers.
