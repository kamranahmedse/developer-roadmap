# Jaeger

Jaeger is an open-source, end-to-end distributed tracing system developed by Uber Technologies. It's designed to monitor and troubleshoot microservices-based distributed systems. Jaeger helps to track requests as they flow through complex distributed systems, identifying performance bottlenecks and understanding system behavior. It supports OpenTracing standards, allowing for vendor-neutral instrumentation of applications. Jaeger features include distributed context propagation, dependency analysis, and root cause analysis. It offers a web UI for visualizing traces and a flexible architecture supporting various storage backends. Jaeger is particularly useful in cloud-native environments, helping developers and operators understand latency issues, optimize performance, and debug problems in microservices architectures.
