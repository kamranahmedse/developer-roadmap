# DMARC

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) is an email authentication protocol that builds upon SPF and DKIM to protect against email spoofing and phishing attacks. It allows domain owners to specify how email receivers should handle messages that fail authentication checks. DMARC provides a feedback mechanism for domain owners to receive reports on email authentication results, helping them monitor and improve their email security. By implementing DMARC policies, organizations can enhance their email deliverability, protect their brand reputation, and reduce the likelihood of their domain being used in fraudulent email campaigns. DMARC is widely adopted by major email providers and is considered a crucial component of modern email security strategies.
