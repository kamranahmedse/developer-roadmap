# Vault

Vault is a tool for securely storing and managing secrets, such as passwords, API keys, and other sensitive information. It is developed and maintained by Hashicorp and is available as open-source software.

Vault is designed to be highly scalable and flexible, with a wide range of features for managing secrets, including:

- Encryption: Vault uses encryption algorithms and protocols, such as AES and RSA, to securely store secrets.
- Access controls: Vault supports role-based access controls and multi-factor authentication to ensure that only authorized users or systems can access secrets.
- Secret rotation: Vault supports automatic secret rotation, allowing secrets to be regularly rotated to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
- Auditing: Vault provides auditing capabilities, allowing administrators to track and monitor access to secrets.

Vault is commonly used in DevOps environments to securely store and manage secrets, and it is often used in conjunction with other tools, such as Kubernetes and Helm, to automate the deployment and management of cloud-native applications.
