# HTTPS

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, encrypting data exchanged between a client and a server. It uses SSL/TLS protocols to provide authentication, data integrity, and confidentiality. HTTPS prevents eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks by encrypting all communications. It uses digital certificates to verify the identity of websites, enhancing trust and security. HTTPS is crucial for protecting sensitive information like login credentials and financial data. It has become the standard for secure web communication, with major browsers marking non-HTTPS sites as "not secure." HTTPS also provides SEO benefits and is essential for many modern web features and progressive web applications.
