# Forward Proxy

A forward proxy, often simply called a proxy, is a server that sits between client devices and the internet, forwarding requests from clients to web servers. It acts on behalf of clients, potentially providing benefits like anonymity, security, and access control. Forward proxies can cache frequently requested content, filter web traffic, bypass geographical restrictions, and log user activity. They're commonly used in corporate networks to enforce internet usage policies, enhance security by hiding internal network details, and improve performance through caching. Unlike reverse proxies, which serve resources on behalf of servers, forward proxies primarily serve client-side needs, acting as an intermediary for outbound requests to the wider internet.
