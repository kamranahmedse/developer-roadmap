# Apache

Apache HTTP Server, commonly known as Apache, is an open-source web server software that serves web content and applications over the internet. It is one of the oldest and most widely used web servers, known for its robustness, flexibility, and extensive feature set. Apache supports various modules that enhance its functionality, such as authentication, URL rewriting, and SSL/TLS encryption. It is highly configurable through its `.conf` files, allowing administrators to tailor the server's behavior to meet specific needs. Apache is compatible with multiple operating systems and integrates with other technologies, making it a popular choice for hosting websites and web applications.
