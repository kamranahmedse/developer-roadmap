# Git

Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, maintaining a complete history of modifications. Git features local repositories on each developer's machine, enabling offline work and fast operations. It supports non-linear development through branching and merging, facilitating parallel work streams. Git's distributed nature enhances collaboration, backup, and experimentation. Key concepts include commits, branches, merges, and remote repositories. With its speed, flexibility, and robust branching and merging capabilities, Git has become the standard for version control in modern software development, powering platforms like GitHub and GitLab.
