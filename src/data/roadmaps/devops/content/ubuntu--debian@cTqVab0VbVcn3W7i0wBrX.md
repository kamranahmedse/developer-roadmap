# Ubuntu / Debian

Ubuntu and Debian are both popular Linux distributions, with Debian serving as the upstream base for Ubuntu. Debian is known for its stability, extensive package repository, and rigorous testing process, making it a favored choice for servers and systems requiring long-term support. Ubuntu, derived from Debian, aims to provide a more user-friendly experience with regular releases, a focus on ease of use, and commercial support options. It features a more streamlined installation process, extensive documentation, and an active community. Both distributions use the Debian package management system (APT) and share many underlying technologies, but Ubuntu emphasizes a more polished desktop experience and rapid release cycle.
