# Netlify

Netlify Functions are serverless functions that allow developers to run server-side code in a JAMstack environment without managing servers. They are built on AWS Lambda and automatically deploy alongside your Netlify site. These functions can handle tasks like API requests, form submissions, and database operations, enabling dynamic functionality in static sites. They support various languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, and Go. Netlify Functions integrate seamlessly with Netlify's deployment pipeline, offering easy development, testing, and production deployment.
