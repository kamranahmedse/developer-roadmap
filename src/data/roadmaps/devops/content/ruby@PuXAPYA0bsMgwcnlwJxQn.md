# Ruby

Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and productivity. Created by Yukihiro Matsumoto, Ruby emphasizes the principle of "least astonishment," aiming for natural, easy-to-read syntax. It features automatic memory management, dynamic typing, and support for multiple programming paradigms including functional and imperative programming. Ruby's flexibility and expressive nature make it popular for web development, particularly with the Ruby on Rails framework. It excels in text processing, scripting, and rapid prototyping. Ruby's extensive standard library and package manager (RubyGems) provide a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries. While not as performant as some compiled languages, Ruby's focus on developer happiness and productivity has made it a favorite in startups and for building web applications quickly.
