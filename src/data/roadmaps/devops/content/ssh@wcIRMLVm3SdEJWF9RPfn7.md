# SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely access and manage remote machines over an unsecured network. It provides encrypted communication, ensuring confidentiality and integrity, and allows for secure file transfers, command execution, and tunneling. SSH is widely used for remote administration of servers, cloud infrastructure, and networking devices, typically employing key-based authentication or passwords. Tools like OpenSSH are commonly used to establish SSH connections, providing a secure alternative to older, less secure protocols like Telnet.
