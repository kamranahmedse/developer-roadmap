# Container Orchestration

Container orchestration is the process of managing and automating the lifecycle of containers, including their deployment, scaling, and networking across multiple hosts. It is a critical technology for running complex containerized applications in production environments.

By leveraging tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Apache Mesos, organizations can ensure high availability, scalability, and reliability for their applications. Container orchestration simplifies operations by automating routine tasks and providing a robust foundation for microservices, cloud-native development, and DevOps practices.
