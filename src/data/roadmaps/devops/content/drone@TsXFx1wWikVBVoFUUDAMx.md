# Drone

Drone is an open-source continuous integration (CI) platform built on container technology. It automates building, testing, and deploying code using a simple, YAML-based pipeline configuration stored alongside the source code. Drone executes each step of the CI/CD process in isolated Docker containers, ensuring consistency and reproducibility. It supports multiple version control systems, offers parallel execution of pipeline steps, and provides plugins for integrating with various tools and services. Drone's lightweight, scalable architecture makes it suitable for projects of all sizes, from small teams to large enterprises. Its focus on simplicity and containerization aligns well with modern DevOps practices and microservices architectures.
