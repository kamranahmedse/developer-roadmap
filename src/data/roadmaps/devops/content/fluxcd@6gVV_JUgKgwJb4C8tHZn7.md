# Flux CD

FluxCD is a GitOps-based continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It automates the deployment of applications by using Git repositories as the source of truth for defining the desired state of a system. FluxCD continuously monitors these repositories and automatically applies changes to the cluster when differences are detected. It supports multi-tenancy, Helm releases, and provides features like automated image updates and notifications. FluxCD enables declarative, version-controlled infrastructure and application management, promoting consistency across environments and simplifying the deployment process. Its integration with Kubernetes makes it particularly useful for cloud-native applications, allowing teams to implement efficient, automated, and auditable deployment workflows.
