# Flux CD

Flux CD is a continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that is based on the GitOps methodology. It is used to automate the deployment and management of cloud-native applications by continuously synchronizing the desired application state with the actual application state in the production environment.

In a Flux CD workflow, changes to the application are made by committing code or configuration changes to a Git repository. Flux CD monitors the repository and automatically deploys the changes to the production environment using a continuous delivery pipeline. The pipeline is triggered by changes to the Git repository and is responsible for building, testing, and deploying the changes to the production environment.

Flux CD is designed to be a simple and efficient way to manage cloud-native applications, as it allows developers to make changes to the system using familiar tools and processes and it provides a clear and auditable history of all changes to the system. It is often used in conjunction with tools such as Helm to automate the deployment and management of cloud-native applications.
