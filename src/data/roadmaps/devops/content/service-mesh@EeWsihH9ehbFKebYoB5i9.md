# Service Mesh

A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that manages communication between microservices in a distributed application. It provides features like load balancing, service discovery, encryption, observability, and traffic management, allowing services to communicate securely and efficiently. By abstracting network-related concerns from the application code, a service mesh enhances reliability and security while simplifying the management of microservice interactions. Popular service mesh implementations include Istio, Linkerd, and Consul.
