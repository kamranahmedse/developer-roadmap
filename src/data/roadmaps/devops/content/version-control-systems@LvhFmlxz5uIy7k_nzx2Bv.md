# Version Control Systems

Version control systems (VCS) are tools that track changes to code and files over time, enabling multiple users to collaborate on projects, maintain history, and manage different versions of codebases. They help in tracking modifications, merging changes, and resolving conflicts. There are two main types of VCS: centralized and distributed. Centralized systems (like Subversion and CVS) rely on a single central repository, while distributed systems (like Git and Mercurial) allow each user to have a complete copy of the repository, including its history. Distributed VCSs, such as Git, are particularly popular for their flexibility, branching capabilities, and robust support for collaborative workflows.
