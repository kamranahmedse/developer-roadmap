# Networking Protocols

Networking protocols are standardized rules and procedures that govern how data is transmitted, received, and interpreted across computer networks. They define the format, timing, sequencing, and error control in data communication. Key protocols include:

1.  TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): The fundamental suite for Internet communication.
2.  HTTP/HTTPS: For web browsing and secure data transfer on the web.
3.  FTP/SFTP: File transfer protocols.
4.  SMTP/POP3/IMAP: Email communication protocols.
5.  DNS: For domain name resolution.
6.  DHCP: For automatic IP address assignment.
7.  SSL/TLS: For secure, encrypted communication.
8.  UDP: For fast, connectionless data transmission.
