# LXC

LXC (Linux Containers) is an operating system-level virtualization method for running multiple isolated Linux systems on a single host using a single Linux kernel. It provides a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization, offering near-native performance and density. LXC uses Linux kernel features like cgroups and namespaces to create containers that have their own process and network space, while sharing the same kernel as the host system. This technology allows for efficient resource utilization and rapid deployment of applications. LXC is often used for creating development environments, testing, and running multiple isolated services on a single machine. While similar in concept to Docker, LXC provides a more system-container approach compared to Docker's application-container focus.
