# GitLab CI

GitLab CI is an integrated continuous integration and delivery platform within the GitLab ecosystem. It automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes through pipelines defined in YAML files. GitLab CI offers features like parallel execution, container registry integration, and auto-DevOps, enabling teams to implement robust CI/CD workflows directly from their GitLab repositories without additional tools or infrastructure.
