# GitOps

GitOps is a way of managing infrastructure and application deployments by storing the desired state in a Git repository and using automation to apply changes. It treats Git as the single source of truth, so updates are made by committing changes to the repo, and automated tools reconcile the actual system state with whatâ€™s in Git.
