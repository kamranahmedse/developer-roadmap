# Infrastructure Monitoring

Monitoring refers to the practice of making the performance and status of infrastructure visible. This section contains common tools used for monitoring. This is a very vendor-heavy space - use caution when studying materials exclusively from a given product or project, as there are many conflicting opinions and strategies in use. There is no single solution for the most substantially complex internet-facing applications, so understanding the pros and cons of these tools will be useful in helping you plan how to monitor a system for a given goal.
