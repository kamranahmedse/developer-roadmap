# Cloud Design Patterns

Cloud design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in cloud computing architectures. These patterns address challenges related to scalability, reliability, security, and performance in distributed systems. They provide best practices for designing and implementing cloud-native applications, covering aspects such as data management, messaging, resiliency, and deployment. Examples include the Circuit Breaker pattern for handling faults, the CQRS pattern for separating read and write operations, and the Sidecar pattern for deploying components of an application into a separate process or container. By leveraging these patterns, developers can create more robust, efficient, and maintainable cloud applications that better utilize the benefits of cloud platforms.
