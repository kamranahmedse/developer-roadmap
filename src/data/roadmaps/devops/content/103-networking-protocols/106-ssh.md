# SSH

The SSH (**S**ecure **Sh**ell) is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate over an insecure network. It is a secure alternative to the non-protected login protocols (such as telnet, rlogin) and insecure file transfer methods (such as FTP). It is mostly used for secure Remote Login and File Transfer.

`SFTP = FTP + SSH`
