# Networking Protocols

As a DevOps engineer you will need to understand the basics of networking protocols, how they work, and how they are used in the real world. To get you started, you should learn about, [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite), [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS), [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell), [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol), [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System), [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol), [NTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol).
