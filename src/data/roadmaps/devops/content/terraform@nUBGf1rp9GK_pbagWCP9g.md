# Terraform

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp, used to define, provision, and manage cloud and on-premises infrastructure using declarative configuration files. It supports multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, as well as various services and platforms, enabling infrastructure automation across diverse environments. Terraform's state management and modular structure allow for efficient scaling, reusability, and version control of infrastructure. It is widely used for automating infrastructure provisioning, reducing manual errors, and improving infrastructure consistency and repeatability.
