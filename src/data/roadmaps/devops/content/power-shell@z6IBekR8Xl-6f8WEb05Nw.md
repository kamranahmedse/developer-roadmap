# Powershell

PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language. Built on the .NET framework, PowerShell provides full access to COM and WMI, enabling administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows systems. It uses cmdlets (pronounced "command-lets") for performing actions, and a pipe system for chaining these commands together. PowerShell's object-based nature, as opposed to text-based output, allows for more efficient data manipulation. With its extensive scripting capabilities, support for aliases, and integration with various Microsoft and third-party products, PowerShell has become a powerful tool for automating system administration tasks, managing cloud resources, and developing DevOps practices in Windows-centric environments.
