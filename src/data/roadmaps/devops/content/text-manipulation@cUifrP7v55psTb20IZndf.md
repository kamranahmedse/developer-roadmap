# Text Manipulation

Text manipulation tools are utilities or software that enable users to modify, process, and transform text data efficiently. These tools are often used in scripting, data cleaning, and automation tasks. Common text manipulation tools include `sed` (stream editor) for search and replace, `awk` for pattern scanning and data extraction, and `grep` for searching text using regular expressions. Other popular tools include `cut`, `sort`, `tr`, and `uniq` for various text processing functions. These command-line tools are commonly used in UNIX/Linux environments to handle large text files, automate workflows, and perform complex text transformations.
