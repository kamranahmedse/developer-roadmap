# CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation is a infrastructure-as-code service that allows users to define and provision AWS infrastructure resources using templates. These templates, written in JSON or YAML, describe the desired AWS resources and their properties. CloudFormation automates the creation, update, and deletion of resources, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments across multiple environments. It supports a wide range of AWS services and can manage complex interdependencies between resources. CloudFormation also provides features like change sets for previewing changes, nested stacks for modular designs, and drift detection to identify manual changes. This service enables teams to version control their infrastructure, implement best practices, and streamline the management of AWS resources throughout their lifecycle.
