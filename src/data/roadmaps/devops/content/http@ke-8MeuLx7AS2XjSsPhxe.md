# HTTP

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It's an application-layer protocol that enables the transfer of various types of data, primarily web pages and their components, between clients (usually web browsers) and servers. HTTP operates on a request-response model, where clients send requests for resources, and servers respond with the requested data or error messages. It's stateless by design, meaning each request is independent of previous ones. HTTP supports various methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for different types of operations. While originally designed for plain-text transmission, HTTPS, its secure version using encryption, is now widely adopted to protect data in transit.
