# openSUSE Linux

openSUSE is a Linux-based operating system known for its stability, versatility, and focus on user-friendly system management. It offers two main distributions: openSUSE Leap, a stable, enterprise-grade version with regular point releases, and openSUSE Tumbleweed, a rolling release version with the latest software updates. OpenSUSE is widely used by developers, system administrators, and enterprise environments due to its robust package management via Zypper and YaST (Yet another Setup Tool), which simplifies system configuration. It also supports a wide range of hardware and offers strong community-driven support.
