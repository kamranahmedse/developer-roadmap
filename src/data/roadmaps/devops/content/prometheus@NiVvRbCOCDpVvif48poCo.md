# Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It features a multi-dimensional data model, a flexible query language (PromQL), and an efficient time series database. Prometheus collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays results, and can trigger alerts when specified conditions are observed. It operates on a pull model, scraping metrics from HTTP endpoints, and supports service discovery for dynamic environments. Prometheus is particularly well-suited for monitoring microservices and containerized environments, integrating seamlessly with systems like Kubernetes. Its ecosystem includes various exporters for third-party systems and a built-in alert manager. Widely adopted in cloud-native architectures, Prometheus is a core component of modern observability stacks, often used alongside tools like Grafana for visualization.
