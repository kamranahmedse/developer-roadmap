# Heroku

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. It supports several programming languages and offers a simple, streamlined deployment process using Git. Heroku abstracts away much of the infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus on code rather than server maintenance. It provides features like automatic scaling, continuous integration/deployment pipelines, and add-ons for databases and other services. Heroku's dyno-based architecture allows for easy scaling of applications. While particularly popular among startups and for rapid prototyping due to its ease of use, Heroku also serves larger applications. Its ecosystem includes a marketplace of third-party add-ons, enhancing functionality for various development needs.
