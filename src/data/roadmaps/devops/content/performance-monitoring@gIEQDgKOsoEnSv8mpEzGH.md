# Performance Monitoring

Performance monitoring is the systematic observation and measurement of an IT system's operational efficiency and effectiveness. It involves collecting, analyzing, and reporting on key performance indicators (KPIs) across various components including applications, networks, servers, and databases. This process uses specialized tools to track metrics such as response time, throughput, resource utilization, and error rates. Performance monitoring helps identify bottlenecks, predict potential issues, and optimize system resources. It's crucial for maintaining service level agreements (SLAs), ensuring user satisfaction, and supporting capacity planning. In modern IT environments, performance monitoring often incorporates real-time analytics, AI-driven insights, and automated alerting systems, enabling proactive management of complex, distributed systems and supporting continuous improvement in IT operations and service delivery.
