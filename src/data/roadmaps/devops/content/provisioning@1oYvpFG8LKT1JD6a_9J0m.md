# Provisioning

Provisioning refers to the process of setting up and configuring the necessary IT infrastructure to support an application or service. This includes allocating and preparing resources such as servers, storage, networking, and software environments. Provisioning can be done manually, but in modern DevOps practices, it's typically automated using tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or CloudFormation. These tools allow for infrastructure-as-code, where the entire provisioning process is defined in version-controlled scripts or templates. This approach enables consistent, repeatable deployments across different environments, reduces human error, and facilitates rapid scaling and disaster recovery.
