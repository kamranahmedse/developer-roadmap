# GKE / EKS / AKS

GKE - Google Kubernetes Engine
------------------------------

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by Google Cloud Platform. It allows organizations to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes orchestration. GKE automates cluster management tasks, including upgrades, scaling, and security patches, while providing integration with Google Cloud services. It offers features like auto-scaling, load balancing, and private clusters, enabling developers to focus on application development rather than infrastructure management.

EKS - Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
---------------------------------------

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed Kubernetes platform provided by AWS. It simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications using Kubernetes. EKS automatically handles the Kubernetes control plane, ensuring high availability and security patches. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, supports both EC2 and Fargate launch types, and offers features like managed node groups and cluster autoscaling, enabling organizations to run Kubernetes workloads efficiently without the operational overhead of managing the Kubernetes infrastructure.

AKS - Azure Kubernetes Service
------------------------------

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is Microsoft's managed Kubernetes offering in the Azure cloud platform. It simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications using Kubernetes. AKS handles critical tasks such as health monitoring and maintenance of the Kubernetes control plane, while providing seamless integration with Azure services like Azure Active Directory, Azure Monitor, and Azure Container Registry. It offers features such as automatic scaling, Azure DevOps integration, and support for Windows containers, enabling organizations to focus on application development and innovation rather than cluster management.
