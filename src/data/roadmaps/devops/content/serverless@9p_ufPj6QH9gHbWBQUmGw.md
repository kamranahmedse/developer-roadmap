# Serverless

Serverless is a cloud-computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the infrastructure, allowing developers to focus solely on writing code. In this model, resources are automatically allocated and scaled based on demand, and billing is based on actual usage rather than pre-purchased capacity. Serverless architectures are often used for event-driven workloads and microservices, improving development efficiency and reducing operational overhead. Popular platforms for serverless computing include AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions.
