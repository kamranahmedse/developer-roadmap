# Process Monitoring

Process monitoring is the continuous observation and analysis of processes within an IT system or organization to ensure optimal performance, efficiency, and compliance. It involves tracking key metrics, resource utilization, and behaviors of individual processes or applications running on a system. This practice helps identify anomalies, bottlenecks, or potential issues before they impact overall system performance or user experience. Process monitoring tools typically provide real-time data on CPU usage, memory consumption, I/O operations, and thread activity. They often include features for alerting, logging, and visualization of process data. In modern IT environments, process monitoring is crucial for maintaining system stability, optimizing resource allocation, troubleshooting performance issues, and supporting capacity planning in complex, distributed systems.
