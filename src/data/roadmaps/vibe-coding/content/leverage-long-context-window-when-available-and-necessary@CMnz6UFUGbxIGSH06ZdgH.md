# Leverage long context windows when available and necessary

Some AI tools allow you to paste in a lot of information at once — entire files, multiple documents, long conversation histories. When you're working on something complex, take advantage of this. Paste in your full codebase, your context document, your design notes, and anything else that's relevant. The more the AI understands about your project as a whole, the better decisions it will make. Just be mindful not to overload it with irrelevant information — focus on what's actually useful for the task at hand.
