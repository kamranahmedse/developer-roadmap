# v0

v0 by Vercel is a generative UI tool that helps developers quickly prototype and generate React code. You describe the UI you want, and v0 uses AI to generate the JSX and CSS (using Tailwind CSS) to build it. It's designed to speed up the initial stages of frontend development by providing a starting point that you can then customize and refine.
