# Context

Context is everything when working with AI. The AI only knows what you tell it — it has no memory of your project, your past decisions, or your preferences unless you provide that information in the current session. Managing context well is one of the biggest differences between vibe coders who get great results and those who feel like the AI keeps misunderstanding them. Learning context engineering is a skill that will improve every single interaction you have with AI tools.
