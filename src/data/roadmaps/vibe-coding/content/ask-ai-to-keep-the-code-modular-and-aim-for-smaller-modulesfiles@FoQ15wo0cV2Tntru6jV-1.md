# Ask AI to keep the code modular and aim for smaller modules/files

From the very beginning, tell the AI to keep the code organized into small, focused files rather than dumping everything into one big file. Each file should have one clear purpose — a button component, a helper function, a database query — rather than mixing everything. Modular code is easier to read, easier to fix, and much easier for the AI to work with in future sessions because it can focus on one small piece at a time instead of trying to understand a massive file all at once. Think of it like organizing a house — when everything has its own place, it's easy to find what you need and easy to fix something without disturbing everything else.
