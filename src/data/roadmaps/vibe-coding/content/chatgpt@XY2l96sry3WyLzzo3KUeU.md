# ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a large language model chatbot developed by OpenAI. You can give it a prompt, and it'll generate text that attempts to answer or continue the conversation. Think of it as a super-smart auto-complete that can understand context and hold a conversation. It's been used for things like writing code, answering questions, and even creative writing.
