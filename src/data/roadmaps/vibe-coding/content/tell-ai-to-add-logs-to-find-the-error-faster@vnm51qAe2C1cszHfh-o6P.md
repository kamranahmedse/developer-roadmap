# Tell AI to add logs to find the error faster

If the error isn't obvious, ask the AI to add log statements throughout the relevant parts of the code. Logs print information to the console as the code runs, showing you exactly what's happening at each step and where things go wrong. This is a classic debugging technique that works just as well in vibe coding. Once you've identified the problem using the logs, you can ask the AI to remove them and apply the proper fix. It's a simple trick that can save a lot of time when the error is buried deep in the logic.
