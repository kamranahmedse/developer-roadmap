# Explicitly tell AI to "think" or "brainstorm" before complex problems

When you're dealing with a tricky problem, don't just ask the AI to jump straight to a solution. Tell it to think through the problem first, consider different approaches, and explain its reasoning before writing any code. This simple instruction can dramatically improve the quality of the output because it forces the AI to slow down and work through the problem more carefully rather than defaulting to the first solution that comes to mind. For complex architecture decisions or hard bugs, this extra thinking step often makes all the difference.
