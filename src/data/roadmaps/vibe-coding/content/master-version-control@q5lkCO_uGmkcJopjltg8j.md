# Master Version Control

Version control is the system you use to track changes to your code over time. The most popular tool for this is Git. Think of it like a save history for your project — every time you make a meaningful change, you save a snapshot of it, and if something breaks later, you can go back to a version that was working. For vibe coders, version control is especially important because AI can sometimes make sweeping changes that break things unexpectedly, and having a recent save point means you never lose too much progress.
