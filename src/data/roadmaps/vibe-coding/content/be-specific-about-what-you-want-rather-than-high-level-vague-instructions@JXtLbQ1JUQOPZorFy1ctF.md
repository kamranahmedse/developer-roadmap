# Be specific about what you want rather than high-level vague instructions

The more detail you give, the better the output. Saying "make a dashboard" gives the AI very little to work with, whereas saying "make a dashboard with a sidebar on the left, a stats overview at the top with three cards showing total users, revenue, and active sessions, and a data table below" gives it a clear picture to build from. Think about what the result should actually look like and describe it as precisely as you can. You don't need to use technical jargon — plain, descriptive language works just as well as long as it's specific.
