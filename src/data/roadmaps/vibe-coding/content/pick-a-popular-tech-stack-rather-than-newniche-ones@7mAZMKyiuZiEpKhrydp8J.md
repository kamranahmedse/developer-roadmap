# Pick a popular tech stack rather than new/niche ones

Stick to well-known technologies like React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, or Supabase rather than chasing the newest or most obscure tools. Popular stacks have more documentation, more tutorials, more community support, and most importantly, AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT have been trained with so much more code written in those technologies. When you use a niche or brand-new tool, the AI is less familiar with it, which means it makes more mistakes, gives weaker suggestions, and you'll find it harder to get help when things go wrong. As a beginner, your goal is to reduce friction, and a popular stack does exactly that.
