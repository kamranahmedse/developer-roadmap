# Pick a popular tech stack rather than new/niche ones

Use popular tech stacks like React, Next.js, Tailwind, and Supabase. AI has been trained on a lot of code using these tools, so it gives better results.  For mobile, desktop, or hardware projects, the same rule applies: stick to established tools. If you use something niche or very new, AI will make more mistakes, and you will spend more time fixing things. Popular stacks also have more tutorials and community support, which helps when you get stuck.
