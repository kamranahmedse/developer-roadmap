Once tests are in place, refactor regularly

One of the biggest benefits of having a good test suite is that it gives you the freedom to refactor your code without fear. Refactoring means cleaning up and reorganizing the code without changing what it does — breaking large files into smaller ones, removing duplicate logic, improving performance. Without tests, refactoring is risky because you can't easily tell if you've accidentally broken something. With tests, you can make sweeping improvements and immediately know if anything has gone wrong because the tests will fail. Once your tests are in place, make refactoring a regular part of your workflow and let the AI do the heavy lifting while your tests keep everything in check.
