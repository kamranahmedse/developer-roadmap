# The Vibe Coder Mindset

AI is more like junior developer working next to you. You don't ask one question and leave. You have conversation with it. You give context, check what it gives back, tell it when something is wrong, and guide it to what you need. If you explain your idea clearly, it works better.

This is very different from traditional programming where you must know exact syntax and write everything yourself. With AI, your role changes; you become the person who directs, not the person who types code. You set the vision, review output, and keep project going in right direction. You still need to understand basics of programming, but you don't need to memorize syntax or figure out every small detail on your own anymore.
