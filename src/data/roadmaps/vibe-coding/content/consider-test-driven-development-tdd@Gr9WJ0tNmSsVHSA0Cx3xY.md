# Consider Test-driven development (TDD)

Test-driven development is an approach where you write the test before you write the actual code. You describe what the feature should do, the AI writes a test that checks for that behavior, and then it writes the code that makes the test pass. This might sound backwards at first, but it forces clarity about what you're actually trying to build before you start building it, which leads to cleaner and more reliable code. It also means you always have a clear definition of "done" — the feature is finished when the test passes. For vibe coders, TDD pairs very naturally with AI because you can simply describe the expected behavior and ask AI to handle both the test and the implementation.
