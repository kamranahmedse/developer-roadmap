# Install and ask AI to use MCP

MCP stands for Model Context Protocol, and it allows AI tools to connect with external tools and services — like a browser, a database, or a file system. For example, Playwright is a tool that lets AI interact with and test your app directly in the browser, which makes debugging frontend issues much faster and more accurate. When these integrations are available, they give the AI real-world visibility into what's actually happening in your app rather than just guessing from the code alone. Setting them up takes a little effort upfront but pays off significantly when things go wrong.
