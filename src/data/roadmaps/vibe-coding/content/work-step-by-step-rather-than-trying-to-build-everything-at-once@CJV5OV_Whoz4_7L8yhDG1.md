# Work step by step rather than trying to build all at once

Ask AI to build one feature at a time, test it, make sure it works, and then move on to the next. When you ask AI to build too many things at once, the code gets tangled, things break in unexpected ways, and it becomes very hard to figure out what went wrong or where. Working in small steps also means that when something doesn't work, you know exactly what caused it because you only changed one thing at a time.
