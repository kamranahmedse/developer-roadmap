# Work step by step rather than trying to build all at once

Build one feature at a time. Ask the AI to do it, test it, make sure it works, then move to the next one. If you ask AI to build too many things at once, things will break, and you won't know why. Small steps make debugging easy because you only changed one thing, so you know exactly where the problem is.
