# Ask AI to write tests

Every time the AI builds a new feature, ask it to write tests for that feature before moving on. One particularly valuable type of test is an end-to-end test, often called an E2E test, which simulates a real user going through your app — clicking buttons, filling in forms, navigating between pages — and checks that everything works as expected from start to finish. Having E2E tests in place means you can make changes to your code with confidence, knowing that if something breaks the user experience, a test will catch it immediately.
