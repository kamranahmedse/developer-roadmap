# Security Best Practices

Security is one of those topics that beginners tend to ignore until something goes wrong — and by then it can be very costly. When you're building with AI, it's easy to focus entirely on getting features working and overlook the fact that your app might be handling sensitive user data, processing payments, or exposing APIs to the public internet. AI won't automatically make your app secure unless you ask it to. Building good security habits early is much easier than trying to fix a vulnerable app after it's already been deployed and is being used by real people.
