# Plan before you Code

Before you start coding with AI, have a plan. Define your MVP and break the project into phases. Don't try to build everything at once; work step by step. Give AI examples like mockups, screenshots, or code samples so it understands what you want. You can even use AI itself to help you plan. Tell it your idea, let it help you refine it, and break it into phases. Little planning at the start saves many hours of fixing later.
