# Plan before you Code

Before you ask AI to build anything, take some time to think through what you actually want to make. A lot of beginners jump straight into prompting and end up with a messy project that goes in circles — adding features randomly, changing direction halfway through, and ending up with something that doesn't really work. The planning phase doesn't have to be formal or complicated; it just means getting clear on what you're building, who it's for, and what it needs to do. Investing some time in planning saves you hours of frustration later and gives the AI a much clearer direction to work with.
