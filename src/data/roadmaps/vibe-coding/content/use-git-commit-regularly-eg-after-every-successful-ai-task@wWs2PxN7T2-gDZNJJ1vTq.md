# Use git commit regularly

Make it a habit to run a Git commit every time the AI completes a task successfully and the result looks good. If the next task goes badly wrong, you lose nothing more than that one task, rather than hours of work. Over time, your commit history also becomes a useful record of how your project evolved, which can help when you need to understand why a certain decision was made or when something first started breaking.
