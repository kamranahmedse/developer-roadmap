# Regularly update your context document

Your context document is a file where you store everything the AI needs to know about your project — your tech stack, your coding preferences, your folder structure, and any rules you've established along the way. Instead of re-explaining all of this at the start of every session, you paste the document in once, and the AI is immediately up to speed. This matters more than most beginners realize because every word you send to an AI costs tokens, and tokens cost money. The more time you spend re-explaining the same context over and over, the more you're paying for information the AI has already processed before. A well-maintained context document means shorter prompts, fewer misunderstandings, and ultimately a lower bill — especially as your project grows and your sessions get longer.
