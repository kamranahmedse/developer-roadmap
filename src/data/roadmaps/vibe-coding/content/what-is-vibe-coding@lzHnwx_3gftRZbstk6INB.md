# Vibe Coding

Vibe coding" is software development method where you use AI and LLMs to generate code through natural language prompts instead of writing it by hand. Term was coined by Andrej Karpathy. The idea is you describe what you want the application to do, and AI builds it. Good for fast prototyping. You don't need to review every line of code. Makes development faster and more accessible for people who are not traditional programmers.
