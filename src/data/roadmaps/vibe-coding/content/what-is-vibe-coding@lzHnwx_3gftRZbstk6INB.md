# Vibe Coding

"Vibe coding" is a software development method in which you use AI and LLMs to generate code via natural-language prompts rather than writing it by hand. The idea is you describe what you want the application to do, and AI builds it. Good for fast prototyping. You don't need to review every line of code. Makes development faster and more accessible for people who are not traditional programmers.
