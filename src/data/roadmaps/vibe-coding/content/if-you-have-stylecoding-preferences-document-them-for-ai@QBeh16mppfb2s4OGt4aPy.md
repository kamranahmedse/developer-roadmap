# If you have style/coding preferences, document them for AI


Write down your preferences — folder structure, naming conventions, coding patterns — in a dedicated file (e.g., a CLAUDE.md)  and share it with AI at the start of each session. This stops you from correcting the same things over and over and keeps the code consistent throughout the project.
