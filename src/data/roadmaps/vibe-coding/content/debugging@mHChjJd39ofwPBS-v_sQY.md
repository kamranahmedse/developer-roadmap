AI is very good at fixing errors when you give it the right information. Paste the error message directly, let it diagnose the problem, and if it keeps failing after a few attempts, ask it to list all possible causes instead of guessing. Use logs to trace exactly where things go wrong, and when available, use MCP tools to give AI direct visibility into what is happening inside your app in real time.
