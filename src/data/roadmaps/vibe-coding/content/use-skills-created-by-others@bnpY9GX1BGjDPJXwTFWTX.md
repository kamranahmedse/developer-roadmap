# Use skills created by others

One of the most powerful features of modern AI tools is the ability to extend what they can do through skills — pre-built capabilities that others have already developed and shared. Think of skills like plugins or add-ons that you can drop into your AI tool to give it new abilities, whether that's connecting to a specific API, following a particular coding pattern, or automating a repetitive workflow. There is a growing open ecosystem of skills built by developers, and many AI tools are starting to support a shared standard that makes these skills plug-and-play across different platforms. Instead of spending time figuring out how to get your AI to do something from scratch, chances are someone has already built a skill for it.
