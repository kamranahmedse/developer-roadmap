# Tech Stack and Coding

Your tech stack is the set of tools and technologies you use to build your project — such as your frontend framework, database, and hosting platform. As a vibe coder, you don't need to master every option out there, but you do need to make a smart choice early on because switching later is painful and time-consuming. If you're a beginner, a wise decision is to choose popular, well-documented stacks, as AI will be more familiar with them, thereby reducing the chances of creating mistakes.
