# Tech Stack and Coding

AI works better with popular tech stacks like React, Next.js, Python, and Tailwind. If you use something niche, expect more errors. Go with what's popular. Write down your coding preferences and give them to AI before you start, otherwise it will make its own choices.

Always tell AI to keep code small and modular. It will try to put everything in one file if you let it. And do refactoring sessions regularly, ask AI to review the codebase, and clean up the mess. If you skip this, things get out of control fast.
