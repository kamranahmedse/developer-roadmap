#Plan what you need to develop (MVP, Different Phases)

Start by planning your MVP — your Minimum Viable Product. This is the simplest version of your idea that still works and solves the core problem. For example, if you're building a task manager app, your MVP might just be the ability to add, view, and delete tasks — nothing more. Don't try to build everything at once. Break your project into phases, where phase one is the basic working version and later phases add more features like user accounts, notifications, or analytics. This keeps things manageable for you and AI, gives you something working early on, and makes it much easier to track progress without feeling overwhelmed.
