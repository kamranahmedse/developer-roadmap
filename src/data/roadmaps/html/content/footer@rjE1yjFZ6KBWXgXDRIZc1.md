# Footer

The `<footer>` element in HTML represents a container for introductory content or navigation links that typically appear at the end of a section or document. It usually contains information about the author, copyright data, terms of use, contact information, related documents, and sometimes navigation. A footer is not necessarily restricted to the bottom of the page; it can be used within sections to denote the end of that specific content area.
