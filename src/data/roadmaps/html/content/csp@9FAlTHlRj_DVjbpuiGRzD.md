# Content Security Policy

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security standard introduced to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other code injection attacks. It works by allowing you to define a whitelist of sources that the browser is permitted to load resources from. This helps to control the origins of scripts, stylesheets, images, and other assets, effectively reducing the attack surface of a web application.
