# Labels and Inputs

Labels and inputs are fundamental building blocks for creating forms in HTML. Labels provide descriptive text that tells users what information is expected in a corresponding input field. Input elements, on the other hand, are the interactive controls where users can enter data, such as text, numbers, dates, or make selections from options. They work together to create a user-friendly and accessible form experience.
