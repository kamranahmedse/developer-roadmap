# Horizontal Rule

The `<hr>` tag in HTML creates a thematic break in an HTML page and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule. It's used to separate content visually, like dividing sections of text or indicating a change in topic. The `<hr>` tag is an empty element, meaning it doesn't have a closing tag.
