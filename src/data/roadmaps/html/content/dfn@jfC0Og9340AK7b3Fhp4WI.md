# dfn

The `<dfn>` element in HTML represents the defining instance of a term. It's used to indicate the specific location where a word or phrase is being defined for the first time within a document. Typically, the term being defined is included within the `<dfn>` tags, and often a definition or explanation of the term is provided nearby.
