# Meta Tags

Meta tags are HTML elements that provide metadata about a webpage. This data is not displayed on the page itself but is used by browsers, search engines, and other web services to understand the content and purpose of the page. They are placed within the `<head>` section of an HTML document and can specify information like character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport settings.
