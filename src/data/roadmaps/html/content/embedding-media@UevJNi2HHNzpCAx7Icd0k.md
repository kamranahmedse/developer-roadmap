# Embedding Media

Embedding media in HTML involves integrating multimedia content like images, audio, and video directly into a webpage. This allows users to view or listen to these elements without having to download them separately or navigate to another site. HTML provides specific elements, such as `<img>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>`, to facilitate this embedding process, along with attributes to control their appearance and behavior.
