# Main Element

The `<main>` element in HTML defines the primary content of a document's `<body>`. It should contain the central topic of the page, excluding any content that is repeated across multiple pages, such as navigation, headers, or footers. Using `<main>` helps improve accessibility and provides a clear structure for search engines and assistive technologies to understand the page's purpose.
