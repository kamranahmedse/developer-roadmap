# HTML Form Constraints

HTML form constraints are rules you set on form fields to control what kind of data users can enter. These constraints help ensure that the information submitted is valid and meets your requirements. For example, you can specify that a field is required, set a minimum or maximum length for text, or restrict the input to a specific data type like a number or email address. These limitations are defined using HTML attributes directly within the form elements.
