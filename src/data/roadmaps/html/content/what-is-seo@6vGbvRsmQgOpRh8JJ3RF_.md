# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Search Engine Optimization, or SEO, is the practice of improving your website to increase its visibility when people search for products or services related to your business in search engines like Google. The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to garner attention and attract prospective and existing customers to your business. A related concept, Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), focuses on optimizing content for AI-powered search experiences, ensuring your information is accurately and effectively presented in AI-generated summaries and responses.
