# img vs. figure

The `<img>` tag in HTML is used to embed a simple image directly into a webpage. It requires a `src` attribute to specify the image source. On the other hand, the `<figure>` element represents self-contained content, like an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc., that is referenced as a single unit. It is typically used with the `<figcaption>` element to provide a caption for the figure.
