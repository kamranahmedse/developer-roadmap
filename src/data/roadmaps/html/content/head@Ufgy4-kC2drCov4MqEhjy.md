# head

The `<head>` element in HTML acts as a container for metadata (data about data) about the HTML document. This metadata isn't displayed on the page itself, but it provides information like the document's title, character set, linked stylesheets, scripts, and other important configurations that help browsers and search engines understand and process the HTML document correctly.
