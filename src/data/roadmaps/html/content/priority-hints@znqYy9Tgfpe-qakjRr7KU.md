# Priority Hints

Priority Hints in HTML allow developers to indicate the relative priority of fetching resources like images. This helps the browser decide which images to load first, potentially improving page load times and user experience by prioritizing content that is immediately visible or more important to the user. This is achieved using the `fetchpriority` attribute.
