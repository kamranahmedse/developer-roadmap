# Inline CSS

Inline CSS involves applying styles directly to individual HTML elements using the `style` attribute. This method allows you to define specific visual properties for a single element, overriding any styles defined in external stylesheets or internal style blocks. It's useful for quick, element-specific styling, but can become difficult to manage for larger projects due to its lack of reusability and separation of concerns.
