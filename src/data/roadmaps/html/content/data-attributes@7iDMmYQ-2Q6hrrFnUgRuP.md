# Data Attributes

Data attributes are special attributes in HTML that allow you to store extra information directly within HTML elements. These attributes start with `data-` followed by a name of your choosing. They are primarily used to store custom data private to the page or application, meaning they are not intended for use by search engines or other external services. This data can then be accessed and used by JavaScript to enhance the functionality and interactivity of your web pages.
