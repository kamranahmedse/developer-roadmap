# HTML Comments

Comments in HTML are notes that you can add to your code to explain what's going on, make reminders, or temporarily disable parts of your code. These comments are not displayed in the browser, so they're only visible when someone views the source code. To create a comment in HTML, you enclose your text within `<!--` and `-->`. Anything between these tags will be ignored by the browser.
