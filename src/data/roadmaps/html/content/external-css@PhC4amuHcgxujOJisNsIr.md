# External CSS

External CSS involves creating separate files (with a `.css` extension) to hold all the styling rules for an HTML document. These CSS files are then linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag, allowing you to apply the same styles across multiple pages and keep your HTML code clean and organized. This approach promotes reusability and maintainability of your website's design.
