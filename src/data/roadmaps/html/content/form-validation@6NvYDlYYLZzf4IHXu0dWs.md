# Form Validation

Form validation is the process of checking if the information a user provides in a form is correct and complete before it's submitted. This ensures that the data received is accurate and meets the required format, preventing errors and improving data quality. It can involve checking for things like required fields, correct email addresses, valid date formats, and acceptable password strength.
