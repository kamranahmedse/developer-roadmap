# Frontend Development

Frontend development is the practice of creating the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. It focuses on the parts of a website that users directly interact with, such as buttons, text, images, and navigation menus. Frontend developers use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build these interactive elements and ensure they are visually appealing and function correctly across different devices and browsers.
