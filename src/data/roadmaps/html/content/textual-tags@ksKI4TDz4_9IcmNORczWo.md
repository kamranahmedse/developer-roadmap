# Textual Tags

Textual tags in HTML are used to structure and format text content on a webpage. They define how text should appear, whether it's a paragraph, heading, emphasized word, or a quoted section. These tags provide semantic meaning to the text, helping browsers and search engines understand the content's organization and purpose.
