# Nested Lists in HTML

Nested lists in HTML allow you to create lists within lists, forming a hierarchical structure. This is achieved by placing one list (either ordered `<ol>` or unordered `<ul>`) inside a list item `<li>` of another list. This creates a sub-list that is visually indented, helping to organize information into related categories and subcategories.
