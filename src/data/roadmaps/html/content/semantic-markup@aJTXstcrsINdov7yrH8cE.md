# Semantic Markup

Semantic markup uses HTML tags to convey the meaning and structure of content, rather than just its appearance. This approach makes web pages more accessible to both humans and machines by providing context about the different parts of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, articles, and navigation menus. By using semantic elements, developers create more organized and understandable code, which improves search engine optimization and overall website usability.
