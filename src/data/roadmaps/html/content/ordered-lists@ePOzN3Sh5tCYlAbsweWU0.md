# Ordered Lists

Ordered lists in HTML are used to display a series of items in a specific order. Each item in the list is typically numbered, allowing readers to easily follow a sequence or ranking. The `<ol>` tag is used to create an ordered list, and each list item is defined using the `<li>` tag.
