# Internal CSS

Internal CSS allows you to add styles directly within an HTML document using the `<style>` tag. This tag is typically placed inside the `<head>` section of your HTML file. Within the `<style>` tag, you can define CSS rules that apply to specific HTML elements on that page, controlling their appearance and layout.
