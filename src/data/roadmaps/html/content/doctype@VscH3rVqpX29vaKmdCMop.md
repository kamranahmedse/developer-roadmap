# !DOCTYPE Declaration

The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is an instruction to the web browser about the HTML version used to write the page. It's placed at the very top of an HTML document, before the `<html>` tag, and ensures that the browser renders the page in "standards mode," following the correct specifications for that HTML version. Technically, It is not an HTML tag itself.
