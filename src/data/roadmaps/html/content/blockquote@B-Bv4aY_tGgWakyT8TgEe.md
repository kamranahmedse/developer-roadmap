# blockquote

The `blockquote` element in HTML represents a section of text that is quoted from another source. It's used to indicate that the enclosed content is an extended quotation, often displayed with indentation or other visual cues to distinguish it from the surrounding text. The `cite` attribute can be used to specify the URL of the source document or message.
