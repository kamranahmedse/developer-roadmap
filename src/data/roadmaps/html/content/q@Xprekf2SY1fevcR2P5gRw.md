# The `<q>` Element

The `<q>` element in HTML represents a short, inline quotation. Browsers typically render this element with quotation marks around the content it contains. It's designed for brief quotes that fit within a paragraph, as opposed to longer, block-level quotations that would use the `<blockquote>` element.
