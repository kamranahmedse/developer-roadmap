# Basic HTML Tags

HTML documents are structured using fundamental tags that define the document's content and structure. The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration informs the browser that the document is an HTML5 document. The `<html>` tag is the root element, encompassing all other HTML elements. Inside `<html>`, the `<head>` tag contains metadata about the document, such as the title and character set, while the `<body>` tag contains the visible content of the webpage. The `<meta>` tag provides metadata like character encoding (`charset="UTF-8"`) to ensure proper text display.
