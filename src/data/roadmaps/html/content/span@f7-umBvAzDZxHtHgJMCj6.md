# Span Element

The `<span>` element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. It is used to group elements for styling purposes or because they share attributes such as `lang` or `dir`. It doesn't inherently represent anything on its own, but becomes useful when combined with CSS or JavaScript to target specific sections of text.
