# Nav

The `<nav>` element in HTML is used to define a section of a page that contains navigation links. It's intended for major navigational blocks, like a site's menu, a table of contents, or a set of breadcrumbs. Using `<nav>` helps structure your content and makes it more accessible to screen readers and search engines by clearly identifying navigation sections.
