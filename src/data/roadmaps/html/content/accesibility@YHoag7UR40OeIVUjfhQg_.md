Accessibility in HTML refers to the practice of designing and developing web content that is usable by people with disabilities. This involves ensuring that websites and web applications are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for individuals who may have visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments, allowing them to access information and interact with the web effectively.
