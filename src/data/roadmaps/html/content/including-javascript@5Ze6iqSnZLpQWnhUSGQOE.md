# Including JavaScript

JavaScript can be added to HTML documents to make web pages interactive. This is done by embedding the JavaScript code directly within the HTML or by linking to external JavaScript files. Embedding uses the `<script>` tag, while linking uses the `<script>` tag with the `src` attribute pointing to the JavaScript file.
