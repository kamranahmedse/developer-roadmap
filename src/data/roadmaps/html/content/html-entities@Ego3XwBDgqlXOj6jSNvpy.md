# HTML Entities

HTML entities are special codes used to represent reserved characters or characters that are difficult to type directly in HTML. They allow you to display characters like angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;), ampersands (&amp;), and copyright symbols (&copy;) that have special meanings in HTML or are not readily available on a standard keyboard. Using entities ensures that these characters are displayed correctly in a web browser.
