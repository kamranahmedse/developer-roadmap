# Using Forms

Forms in HTML are used to collect data from users. They provide a way for users to input information like text, passwords, and selections, and then submit that data to a server for processing. Forms are created using the `<form>` element, which contains various input elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` to define the different fields for user input.
