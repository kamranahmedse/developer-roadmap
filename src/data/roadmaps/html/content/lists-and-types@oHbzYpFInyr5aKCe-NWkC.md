# Lists and Types

Lists in HTML are used to present information in a structured and organized manner. There are primarily two main types: ordered lists (numbered) and unordered lists (bulleted). HTML also supports definition lists, which are used to display terms and their corresponding definitions. Each type of list uses specific HTML tags to define the list structure and its individual items.
