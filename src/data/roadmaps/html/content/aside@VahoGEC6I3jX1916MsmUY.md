# Aside Element

The `<aside>` element in HTML represents a section of a page that is tangentially related to the main content. It's often used for sidebars, pull quotes, or other content that provides additional information or context but isn't essential to understanding the primary content. Think of it as content that can be removed without significantly impacting the user's comprehension of the main topic.
