# b / strong

The `<b>` and `<strong>` tags in HTML are used to make text appear bold. While both achieve a similar visual effect, the `<b>` tag is primarily for stylistic purposes, indicating text that should be visually distinguished without necessarily conveying importance. On the other hand, the `<strong>` tag signifies that the enclosed text has strong importance, seriousness, or urgency.
