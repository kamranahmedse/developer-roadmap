# Class Attribute

The `class` attribute in HTML is used to specify one or more class names for an HTML element. These class names can then be used by CSS and JavaScript to style and manipulate specific elements or groups of elements that share the same class. Essentially, it's a way to categorize and target elements for styling and scripting purposes.
