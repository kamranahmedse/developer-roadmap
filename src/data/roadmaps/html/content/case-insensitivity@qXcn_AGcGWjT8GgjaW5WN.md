# Case Insensitivity

HTML isn't picky about capitalization. You can write tags and attributes using uppercase, lowercase, or a mix of both. For example, `<html>`, `<HTML>`, and `<Html>` all work the same way. While browsers understand all these variations, it's generally considered good practice to stick to lowercase for better readability and consistency in your code.
