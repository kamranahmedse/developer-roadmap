# i / em

The `<i>` and `<em>` tags in HTML are used to emphasize text. The `<i>` tag represents text that is set off from the normal prose, such as technical terms, foreign words, or thoughts. The `<em>` tag represents stress emphasis of its contents. While both may render similarly in browsers (often as italicized text), `<em>` has semantic meaning, indicating importance, whereas `<i>` is purely presentational.
