# Markup Languages

Markup languages are systems for annotating text in a way that makes it readable by both humans and computers. They use tags to define elements within a document, specifying how the text should be structured, formatted, and displayed. For example, HTML uses tags like `<p>` for paragraphs and `<h1>` for headings to structure web content, while XML uses custom tags to define data structures for various applications.
