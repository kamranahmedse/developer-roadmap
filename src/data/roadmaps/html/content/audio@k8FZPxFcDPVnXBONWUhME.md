Audio on the web involves incorporating sound files into HTML documents. This allows users to listen to music, podcasts, or other audio content directly within a webpage. The HTML `<audio>` element is used to embed audio, providing attributes for controlling playback, displaying controls, and specifying multiple source files for browser compatibility.
