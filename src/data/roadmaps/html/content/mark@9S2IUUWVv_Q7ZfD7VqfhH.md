# Mark Text

The `<mark>` tag in HTML is used to highlight specific parts of text within a larger block of content. It's primarily intended to draw the reader's attention to these sections, often because they are relevant to the user's current activity or search query. The default styling usually renders the marked text with a yellow background, but this can be customized using CSS.
