# Whitespaces

Whitespaces in HTML refer to the spaces, tabs, and line breaks that are used to format the code. Browsers typically collapse multiple consecutive whitespaces into a single space when rendering the content. While using whitespaces can improve the readability of your HTML code, they generally don't affect how the page is displayed to the user.
