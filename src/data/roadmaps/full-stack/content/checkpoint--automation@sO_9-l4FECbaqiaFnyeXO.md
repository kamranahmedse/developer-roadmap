Now that you have learnt ansible, you can use it to automate the deployment of your application.

A task for you at this point would be to automate the steps that you manually performed earlier when setting up the EC2 instance i.e. SSH into the server, install Node.js, Git, PostgreSQL, Running the application etc. Write an ansible playbook that automates these and see if you can spin up a new EC2 instance without SSHing into it and manually installing all the dependencies.
