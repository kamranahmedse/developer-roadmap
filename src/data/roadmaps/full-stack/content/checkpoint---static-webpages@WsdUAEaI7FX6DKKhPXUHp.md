# Checkpoint

Now that you have learnt HTML and CSS, you should be able to build static webpages. I recommend you to build as many test projects at each yellow step of the roadmap as possible to solidify what you learn. 

The practice that I used to follow when I was learning was this:

- While you are watching a course or reading a book, make sure to code along with the instructor/author — pause the video at regular intervals and code what you are being taught.
- Search on YouTube and watch a few project based tutorials on the topic that you are learning. Apart from coding along with the instructor:
  - Try to build the same project at least 2 to 3 times on your own without looking at the video. If you get stuck, refer to the section of the video where the instructor builds that part of the project.
  - Build something else that is similar to the project that you just built. For example, if you just built a todo app, try to build a notes app or a reminder app.

## Project Ideas

Now that you have learnt HTML and CSS, here are a few ideas for you to build:

- Try to copy the design of a website that you like. 
  - Here is a [simple blog design in figma](https://www.figma.com/file/nh0V05z3NB87ue9v5PcO3R/writings.dev?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=2iQplaIojU3ydAfW-1) that you can try to copy.
  - Or try to rebuild the [webpages of this website](https://cs.fyi/).
- Take some inspiration from [personal portfolios of others](https://astro.build/showcase/) and build your own personal portfolio
