Now that you have learnt git and GitHub you should be ready to work with others. You should now setup your GitHub profile and push all the projects that you have built so far to your GitHub profile. Here are some of my recommendations for your GitHub profile:

- Keep the repository names lowercase and use hyphens to separate words e.g. `todo-app` instead of `TodoApp` or `Todo-App`.
- Add a `README.md` file to each repository that you create. This file should contain a description of the project. Put some effort into the readme and make sure it clearly details what the project is about and how anyone can run it locally.
- Add snapshots of your project to the readme file so that anyone can see what the project looks like without having to run it locally.
- Add a `LICENSE` file to each repository that you create. This file should contain the license that you want to use for the project. You can use [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) to help you choose a license.

You can have a look at [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/kamranahmedse) and see how I have structured my repositories and how [some of my readme files look like](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/aws-cost-cli).
