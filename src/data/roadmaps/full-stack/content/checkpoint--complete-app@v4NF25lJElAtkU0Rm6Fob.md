At this point, you should have everything that you need to build a complete application that:

*   Has a responsive frontend that users can interact with
*   Has a backend API that is secured with JWT authentication
*   Has a database that stores data

At this point you should practice building as much as you can on your own to solidify your knowledge. If you need inspiration, here are some ideas:

*   Build a simple blogging application where users can register, login, setup their blog and write posts.
*   A single page site builder where users can pick a template, modify it and publish it. **Hint** you will need filesystem to store the design templates. Template files will have placeholders that you will need to replace with user data.
*   Build a simple e-commerce application which will have two types of users i.e. **Sellers** who can: Register as Seller, Login, Setup their store, Add products, Edit products, Delete products, View Received Orders, Update Order Status (Pending, Shipped, Delivered), **Buyers** who can register, Login, Browse products by all sellers, Add products to cart, Checkout, View order history, View order status, Cancel order, View seller profile, View seller products

These are just some ideas to get you started. You can build anything you want. The goal is to practice building a complete application from scratch.
