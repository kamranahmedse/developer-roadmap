At this point, you should be able to install and use external packages using `npm`. You probably know about [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com/) where you can search for packages and read their documentation. You should also be familiar with the `package.json` file and how to use it to manage your project dependencies.

You don't need to get into the module bundlers and build tools just yet. Just make sure that you are able to use the dependencies installed in the `node_modules` folder using simple link and script tags in your HTML.

Regarding projects, here are a few ideas that you can try:

- Create a simple webpage that shows the current time of user. You can use [dayjs](https://day.js.org/) to get the current time and display it on the page. Here is the [sample design for homepage](https://i.imgur.com/yGIMGkr.png).
- Install the [micromodal](https://micromodal.vercel.app/#introduction) library. Create a button on the page clicking which should open a modal and let the user select a timezone from a dropdown. Once the user selects a timezone, the modal should close and the time on the page should be updated to show the time in the selected timezone. Here is the [sample design for the modal](https://imgur.com/a/vFY6Sdl).
