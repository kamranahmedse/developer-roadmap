You should now implement monitoring and autorestarts for your application using monit. Regarding autorestarts, you can also use [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/).

Here are some of the monitors you should implement for the application.

*   CPU Usage
*   Memory Usage
*   Disk Usage
*   Network Usage
*   Service Availability
*   Process Availability

Monit comes with existing configurations for many services. You can find them in `/etc/monit/conf-available`. You can copy them (and modify if required) to `/etc/monit/conf-enabled` to enable them.
