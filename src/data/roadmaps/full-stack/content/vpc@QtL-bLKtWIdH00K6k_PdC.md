# VPC

VPC stands for **Virtual Private Cloud** and is an essential service provided by AWS that allows you to create a private, isolated section within the AWS cloud, where you can define your own virtual network. It offers a more secure and controlled environment, enabling you to easily launch and manage your resources within your personal network.
