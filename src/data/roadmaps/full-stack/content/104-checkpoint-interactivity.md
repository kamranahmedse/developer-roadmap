At this point you should be able to add interactivity to your web pages using JavaScript. You should make sure that you have learnt the following:

- Know about variables, loops, data types, conditionals, functions.
- Know about arrays and objects and different ways to access their data.
- Know how to select DOM elements.
- Add event listeners to DOM elements (e.g. click, focus, form submission).
- Use JavaScript to add and remove DOM elements
- Add and remove classes from DOM elements
- Use JavaScript to make HTTP requests to external APIs (i.e. `fetch`)
- Use JavaScript to store data in the browser's local storage

Here are few ideas to practice your skills:

- Create a simple to-do list app that allows users to search, add, edit, and delete items. Use local storage to store the data. 
- Create a simple webpage where user can put in anyone's GitHub username and see their profile information. You can use GitHub's API to fetch the data. For example, here is the [sample URL to fetch my data](https://api.github.com/users/kamranahmedse). Make sure to add validation and error handling.
- Create a basic calculator app that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.
