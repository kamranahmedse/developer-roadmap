# Monit

When it comes to monitoring the health of your applications, there are several different options available. My favorite monitoring stack is Prometheus and Grafana, but it can be a bit overwhelming to set up and configure. If you're looking for a simpler solution, **Monit** is a great alternative that can be utilized to monitor and manage system resources such as services, processes, files, directories, devices, and network connections, making your application more reliable and resilient to issues like crashes, unresponsiveness, or resource exhaustion.
