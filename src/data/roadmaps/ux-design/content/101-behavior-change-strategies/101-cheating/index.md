# Cheating

Cheating, in the context of behavior change strategies, refers to creating shortcuts and loopholes within a designed system, in order to overcome any obstacles users may face while achieving their goals. As a UX designer, you need to understand that users often look for the easiest path to reach their objectives, even if it means bending or breaking the established rules.

## When to use Cheating:

- **Overcoming limitations**: Allow users to overcome constraints imposed by the system or environment when these limitations prevent them from moving forward in a meaningful way.
- **Increasing motivation**: When users feel stuck or overwhelmed, cheating mechanisms can help them feel a sense of progress or achievement, thus motivating them to keep going.
- **Enhancing user experience**: Sometimes, cheating can create fun and engaging experiences, turning ordinary tasks into enjoyable challenges that users might enjoy exploring and exploiting.

## Designing for Cheating:

When designing cheat mechanisms in your UX, consider the following best practices:

- **Balance**: Cheating should provide an alternative solution without compromising the overall challenge or value offered by the system. Strive for a balance between making tasks easier and avoiding excessive exploitation that could lead to unearned rewards or trivializing the user's experience.
- **Limited Access**: Cheating should not become the default behavior or the most commonly used strategy in your design. Limit access or opportunities to cheat to avoid undermining the user's sense of accomplishment or alienating non-cheating users.
- **Documentation and communication**: If permitting cheating is an intentional design choice, communicate this to your users explicitly, so they don't feel guilty about exploiting loopholes. Making users aware of cheat options can help you foster an environment where users knowingly bend the rules, thus adding an interesting dynamic to the overall user experience.
- **Monitoring**: Constantly monitor how users are interacting with your design and how prevalent cheating behavior is. If cheating becomes too widespread or harmful, consider tweaking the system and addressing any unintended consequences.

By carefully designing and implementing cheating strategies, you can effectively enhance the user experience, while still maintaining the integrity of your system and the motivation of your users. Remember, the goal is to make the experience enjoyable and rewarding, not to provide users with a way to cheat their way to success.
