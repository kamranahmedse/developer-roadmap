# Simple Flowchart

A simple flowchart is a useful deliverable in the UX design process that helps visually represent the flow of a user's journey through a website or an app. It's a diagrammatic representation of the user interactions and decision points, showcasing the steps they will take to achieve a specific goal.

This straightforward visual aid can assist the entire project team, including designers, developers, and stakeholders, to understand the overall structure and organization of the proposed design solution. 

## Key Elements of a Simple Flowchart

- **Shapes**: Standard shapes like rectangles, diamonds, and ovals are utilized to indicate different actions or decisions in a flowchart. Each shape has a specific meaning, which aids in understanding the flow of the user interaction.
- **Lines and Arrows**: These are used to connect the various shapes and define the sequence of steps.
- **Labels**: Brief descriptions or texts inside the shapes describe the action, decision, or process represented by that particular shape.

## Benefits of Using Simple Flowcharts

- **Shared Understanding**: Flowcharts are easy to read and understand, fostering a shared understanding between team members and stakeholders.

- **Effective Communication**: They provide a clear way to communicate the steps involved in a process, making it easier for teams to discuss and collaborate.

- **Identifying Potential Issues**: Flowcharts help identify potential bottlenecks or points of friction in a user's journey, enabling the team to address issues early in the design process.

- **Documentation**: As a deliverable, flowcharts can serve as documentation, capturing the broader structure and steps in a process for future reference.

To create a simple flowchart, start by listing all the essential steps and decisions in the user journey you want to document. Organize them sequentially and then use standard shapes and arrows to create the flowchart. Make sure to include annotations or labels to clarify the meaning of each shape.

In summary, a simple flowchart is a valuable UX deliverable that helps visualize user interactions and design solutions in an easy-to-understand format, facilitating better communication and collaboration within project teams.
