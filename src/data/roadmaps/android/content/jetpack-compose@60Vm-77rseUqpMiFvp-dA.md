# Jetpack Compose

`Jetpack Compose` is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs. `Jetpack Compose` offers a declarative approach to designing UI, where you can simply describe what your UI should look like at any given point of your app’s state, and `Compose` takes care of updating the view hierarchy, making UI development more efficient. It also integrates well with existing Android apps, letting you adopt its benefits at your own pace.
