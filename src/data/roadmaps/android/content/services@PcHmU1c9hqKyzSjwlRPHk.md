# Services

**Services**: A service in Android is an app component that performs operations in the background without a user interface. It can be started by an application component, like an activity, and it will continue to run in the background even if the user switches to another application. There are two types of services in Android, namely, `Started Service` and `Bound Service`. A `Started Service` is used to perform a single operation, such as downloading a large file. On the other hand, a `Bound Service` offers a client-server interface that allows components to interact with the service, send requests, receive results, and even perform interprocess communication (IPC).
