# Authentication

Firebase Authentication in Android provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more. Firebase also facilitates integration of functionality to sign in, sign up, and reset password. Moreover, it can be used to secure your database by implementing role-based access to data and to provide personalized experience according to the user's unique identity.

Firebase Authentication offers two methods to authenticate. These are using an `email/password` login provided by Firebase Authentication or a `federated identity provider` like Google or Facebook. It also covers token-based authentication by creating custom tokens or verifying ID tokens. In addition to this, Firebase Authentication works with Firebase's client SDKs for practical use and works for long-running server processes for some of your users.

Firebase Authentication provides a full suite of capabilities even beyond authentication to make your life easier, which includes Security Rules for Cloud Storage and Cloud Firestore, Firebase Dynamic Links, and Firebase Invites.
