# Remote Config

Firebase Remote Config is a cloud service offered by Firebase. It lets you change the behavior and appearance of your app without requiring a new app release. By using Firebase Remote config, you can customize your app for different user segments, manage the core aspects of your app by modifying parameters externally, and conduct A/B tests to improve your app. It works efficiently by using default values that control the behavior and appearance of your app. When your app needs configuration information, it makes a request to the Firebase Remote Config server. If the server has updated values, these values replace the default ones, hence modifying the app's behavior or appearance according to your needs.
