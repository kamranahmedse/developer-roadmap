# RecyclerView

RecyclerView is the most commonly used and powerful list management tool in Android development. Witch makes it easy to efficiently display large sets of data. You supply the data and define how each item looks, and the RecyclerView library dynamically creates the elements when they're needed.

As the name implies, RecyclerView recycles those individual elements. When an item scrolls off the screen, RecyclerView doesn't destroy its view. Instead, RecyclerView reuses the view for new items that have scrolled onscreen. RecyclerView improves performance and your app's responsiveness, and it reduces power consumption.
