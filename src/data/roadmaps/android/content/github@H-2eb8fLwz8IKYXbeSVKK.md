# GitHub

**GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service for managing software version control using Git. It provides a platform for enabling multiple developers to work together on the same project at the same time. With GitHub, codes can be stored publicly, allowing for collaboration with other developers or privately for individual projects. Key features of GitHub include code sharing, task management, and version control, among others. GitHub also offers functionalities such as bug tracking, feature requests, and task management for the project.
