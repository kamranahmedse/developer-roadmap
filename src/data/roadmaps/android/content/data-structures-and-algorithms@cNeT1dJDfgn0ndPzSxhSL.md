# DataStructures and Algorithms

**Data Structures** are primarily used to collect, organize and perform operations on the stored data more effectively. They are essential for designing advanced-level Android applications. Examples include Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Hash Map, and Tree.

**Algorithms** are a sequence of instructions or rules for performing a particular task. In Android, algorithms can be used for data searching, sorting, or performing complex business logic. Some commonly used algorithms are Binary Search, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, etc. A deep understanding of data structures and algorithms is crucial in optimizing the performance and the memory consumption of the Android applications.
