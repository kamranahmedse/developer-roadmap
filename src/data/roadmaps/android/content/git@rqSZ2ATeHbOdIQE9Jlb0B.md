# Git

`Git` is a highly efficient and flexible distributed version control system that was created by **Linus Torvalds**, the creator of Linux. It allows multiple developers to work on a project concurrently, providing tools for non-linear development and tracking changes in any set of files. Git has a local repository with a complete history and version-tracking capabilities, allowing offline operations, unlike SVN. It ensures data integrity and provides strong support for non-linear development with features such as branching and merging.
