# Content Provider

A **Content Provider** in Android is a key component that allows applications to securely share data with other applications. They act as a layer between databases and applications to enhance data security. Content providers manage access to a structured set of data by handling data transactions, implementing data security, and maintaining isolation between applications. They provide an abstracted interface which is used to access data, while the underlying storage method (Like SQLite database, web, or any other method) remains hidden. This mechanism aids in retrieving data from a non-relational source in a structured way. They're used primarily when data needs to be shared between multiple applications, not just within a single application.
