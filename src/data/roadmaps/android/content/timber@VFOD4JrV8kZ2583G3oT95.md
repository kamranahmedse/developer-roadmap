# Timber

`Timber` is a logging utility tool that has been specifically extended from the `Log` class of Android. It has been built to simplify the logging process while aiming to reduce the amount of boilerplate code the developer has to write. It was designed and is maintained by Jake Wharton, a renowned contributor in the Android Developer community. In Timber, each log message is directed to the next available logger, reducing the redundancy of manually assigning log tags. The simplicity of Timber is highlighted by its ability to log without defining any tag. Most importantly, Timber only logs messages in debug builds by default, avoiding potential data leaks in your production application.
