# BottomSheet

`Bottom sheets` are surfaces containing supplementary content that are anchored to the bottom of the screen.

There are several attributes that can be used to adjust the behavior of both standard and modal bottom sheets. 
Behavior attributes can be applied to standard bottom sheets in xml by setting them on a child View set to `app:layout_behavior` or programmatically.
