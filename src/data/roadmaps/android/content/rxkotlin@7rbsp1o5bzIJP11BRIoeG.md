# RxKotlin

`RxKotlin` is a lightweight library that adds convenient extension functions to `RxJava`. It allows developers to use RxJava with Kotlin in a more idiomatic way, thus making code more readable and understandable. While `RxJava` is a Java-based implementation of Reactive Extensions, `RxKotlin` is essentially a wrapper that includes extension functions and other constructs to take full advantage of Kotlin's features, such as its syntactic simplicity and ease of use.
