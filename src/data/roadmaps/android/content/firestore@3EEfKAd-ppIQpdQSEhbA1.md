# FireStore

Firestore, often referred to as Firebase Firestore or Cloud Firestore, is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Firestore comes with features like expressive querying, real-time updates, and automatic multi-region data replication. It is designed to offer seamless integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud products. It provides a cloud-based NoSQL database, which means the data is stored as collections of documents. Each document, in turn, contains a set of key-value pairs. Firestore ensures durable networking, so data syncs across client apps in real-time, even when the device is offline, making it easier for you to work with distributed data that can be kept in sync across various clients.
