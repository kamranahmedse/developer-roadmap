# Firebase Distribution

Firebase Distribution is a development tool within the Google Firebase suite that allows you to share pre-release versions of your Android apps with your development team. It enables you to distribute your app binaries to multiple testers and teams to get feedback before the app's official launch. Firebase Distribution supports both Android and iOS applications and works in tandem with other features, like Firebase Crashlytics, to effectively manage the testing and debugging aspects of your application's lifecycle.
