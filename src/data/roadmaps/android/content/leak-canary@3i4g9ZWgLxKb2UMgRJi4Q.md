# Leak Canary

LeakCanary is a powerful open-source memory leak detection library for Android and Java. It is integrated into your app, and once you run your app, LeakCanary immediately starts watching for memory leaks and captures a memory dump if it detects one. After investigation, it will present a full stack trace to help you pinpoint the exact location of the memory leak. With the LeakCanary's user-friendly interface, you can then analyze the memory leak right in your app. The most recent version of LeakCanary also includes other improvements like automatic detection of leaks in Activity, Fragment, View, ViewModel, LiveData, etc.
