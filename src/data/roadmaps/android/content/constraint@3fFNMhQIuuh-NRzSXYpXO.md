# ConstraintLayout

Lets you create large, complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy—no nested view groups. It's similar to `RelativeLayout` in that all views are laid out according to relationships between sibling views and the parent layout, but it's more flexible than RelativeLayout and easier to use. Its available on xml and jetpack compose.
