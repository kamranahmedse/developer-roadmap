# JUnit

JUnit is a popular testing framework for Java programming. It forms the basis for many other testing libraries and tools in the Android ecosystem, making it important for any Android developer to become familiar with. The basic use of JUnit involves annotations such as `@Test`, indicating methods that represent a single test case. Other useful features include `@Before` and `@After` which allow for setup and teardown processes to be defined clearly. Another powerful feature in JUnit is the ability to create parameterized tests, effectively running the same test multiple times with different inputs.
