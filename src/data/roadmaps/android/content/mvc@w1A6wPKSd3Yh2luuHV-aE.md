# MVC or Model View Controller

MVC or `Model View Controller` is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected components.

Components:

- `Model`: The internal representations of information. This can often be an Interactor or UseCase
- `View`: The interface that presents information to and accepts it from the user
- `Controller`: The controller contains logic that updates the model and/or view in response to input from the users of the app.
