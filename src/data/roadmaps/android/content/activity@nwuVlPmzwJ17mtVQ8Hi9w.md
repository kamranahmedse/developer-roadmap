# Activity

`Activity` in Android is a crucial component that represents a single screen with a user interface. It is just like a window in a desktop application. Android apps are typically made up of one or more activities, each having its interface which allows user interaction. When an app is launched, an instance of `Activity` is created, starting the lifecycle of that app. Every activity has its own lifecycle (create, start, resume, pause, stop, destroy) that keeps the state of a user's progress, and Android manages these states automatically. Activities can also have `Intent`, which allows them to interact with other components, such as starting another activity or getting a result from that activity.
