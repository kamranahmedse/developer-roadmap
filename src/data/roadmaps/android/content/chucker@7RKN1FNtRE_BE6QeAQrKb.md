# Chucker

`Chucker` is an open-source debugging library created for Android applications. It has been designed to be easy to use and convenient for developers. This library intercepts and records all HTTP requests and responses inside your application, which helps to visualize and share this information in an understandable and easy-to-read format. Using Chucker's distinct features, you can inspect all the HTTP and HTTPS traffic going in and out of your app directly. In addition, it provides other nifty features such as a user-friendly interface to view the server's raw response. It's like having a built-in network inspector in your debugging tool, enabling you to solve network-related issues more efficiently.
