# RelativeLayout

A **RelativeLayout** in Android is a type of ViewGroup that allows you to position child views relative to each other or relative to the parent layout. It's a flexible layout where you can arrange the child views in relation to one another based on certain rules, making it suitable for creating complex UI designs.

**RelativeLayout** was commonly used in earlier Android development, but with the introduction of `ConstraintLayout`, it's less frequently used in modern apps.
