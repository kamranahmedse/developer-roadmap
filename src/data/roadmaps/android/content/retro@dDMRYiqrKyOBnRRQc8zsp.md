# Retrofit

**Retrofit** is a type-safe HTTP client for Android. It's designed to connect your application with an API or a back-end web service. Retrofit uses annotations to encode details about the API's operations and requests, such as the HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`) and the query parameters. The main advantage of **Retrofit** over other similar libraries is in its simplicity and intuitiveness, and it efficiently handles all network calls.
