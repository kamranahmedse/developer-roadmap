# Monitoring and Optimizing Resource Usage

Monitoring and optimizing resource usage in Kubernetes helps ensure workloads run efficiently while minimizing waste and avoiding performance issues. By observing CPU, memory, and storage consumption at the node, pod, and container levels, teams can identify bottlenecks, detect underutilized resources, and make informed scaling decisions. Optimization techniques include right-sizing resource requests and limits, using autoscaling mechanisms, and continuously analyzing metrics through monitoring tools. Effective monitoring and optimization improve cluster stability, reduce costs, and enhance overall application performance.
