# CI CD Integration

Integrating CI/CD with Kubernetes involves setting up a pipeline to build and deploy your application to a Kubernetes cluster. This process typically includes developing your application code, setting up a source code repository, choosing a CI/CD tool, building a Docker image, pushing the image to a container registry, deploying the application using Kubernetes manifests, and monitoring and troubleshooting the pipeline and deployment as needed. By automating the testing and deployment of your applications, CI/CD with Kubernetes can help improve software quality, speed up development, and ensure consistent and reliable deployments.
