# Key Concepts Terminologies

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Here are some important concepts and terminologies in Kubernetes:

- Cluster Architecture: The architectural concepts behind Kubernetes.
- Containers: Technology for packaging an application along with its runtime dependencies.
- Workloads: Understand Pods, the smallest deployable compute object in Kubernetes, and the higher-level abstractions that help you to run them.
- Services, Load Balancing, and Networking: Concepts and resources behind networking in Kubernetes.
- Storage: Ways to provide both long-term and temporary storage to Pods in your cluster.
- Configuration: Resources that Kubernetes provides for configuring Pods.
- Cluster Administration: Lower-level detail relevant to creating or administering a Kubernetes cluster.
