# Observability Engines

Observability in Kubernetes (k8s) refers to the ability to gain insight into the inner workings of your cluster, applications, and services running on top of it. An observability engine in k8s is a tool or platform that facilitates the collection, analysis, and visualization of data from various sources in your k8s environment. Some popular observability engines in k8s include Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, and Elastic Stack (ELK).
