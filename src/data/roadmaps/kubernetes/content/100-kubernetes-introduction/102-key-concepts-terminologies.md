# Key Concepts Terminologies

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Here are some important concepts and terminologies in Kubernetes:

- Cluster Architecture: The architectural concepts behind Kubernetes.
- Containers: Technology for packaging an application along with its runtime dependencies.
- Workloads: Understand Pods, the smallest deployable compute object in Kubernetes, and the higher-level abstractions that help you to run them.
- Services, Load Balancing, and Networking: Concepts and resources behind networking in Kubernetes.
- Storage: Ways to provide both long-term and temporary storage to Pods in your cluster.
- Configuration: Resources that Kubernetes provides for configuring Pods.
- Security: Concepts for keeping your cloud-native workload secure.
- Policies: Policies you can configure that apply to groups of resources.
- Scheduling, Preemption and Eviction: In Kubernetes, scheduling refers to making sure that Pods are matched to Nodes so that the kubelet can run them. Preemption is the process of terminating Pods with lower Priority so that Pods with higher Priority can schedule on Nodes. Eviction is the process of proactively terminating one or more Pods on resource-starved Nodes.
- Cluster Administration: Lower-level detail relevant to creating or administering a Kubernetes cluster.
- Extending Kubernetes: Different ways to change the behavior of your Kubernetes cluster.
