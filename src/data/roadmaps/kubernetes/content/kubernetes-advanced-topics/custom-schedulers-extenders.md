# Custom Schedulers Extenders

Custom Scheduler Extenders in Kubernetes enhance the scheduling capabilities of Kubernetes by allowing users to define their own scheduling logic based on custom metrics and constraints. They are implemented as custom Kubernetes controllers that run alongside the Kubernetes scheduler. Custom Scheduler Extenders can be used to implement scheduling policies specific to an organization's needs and can be developed using various programming languages. They intercept scheduling requests, add custom scheduling logic based on user-defined rules, and pass requests back to the Kubernetes scheduler.
