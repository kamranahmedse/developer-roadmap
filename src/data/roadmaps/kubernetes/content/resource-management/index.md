# Resource Management

Resource management in Kubernetes involves managing CPU, memory, and storage resources to ensure efficient and effective use of resources. Kubernetes provides several features and tools, including resource quotas, limits, node affinity and anti-affinity, horizontal and vertical pod autoscaling, and cluster autoscaling to manage resources effectively. These features help ensure that resources are allocated fairly, resource contention is avoided, and pods have access to the resources they need. By using these features, Kubernetes can efficiently manage resources, leading to better performance, improved reliability, and reduced costs.
