# Custom Resource Definitions

Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) in Kubernetes extend the Kubernetes API by defining new resource types specific to an organization's needs. CRDs create custom resources that can manage a wide variety of resources, such as applications, databases, storage, and networking. They are defined using YAML or JSON manifests and can be created and managed using the Kubernetes API server. Once created, custom resources can be managed using Kubernetes controllers and integrated with other Kubernetes components. CRDs are a powerful tool for streamlining operations in Kubernetes and enabling organizations to manage resources in a more efficient and customized way.
