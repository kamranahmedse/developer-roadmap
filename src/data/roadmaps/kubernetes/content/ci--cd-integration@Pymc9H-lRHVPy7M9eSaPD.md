Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It allows developers to focus on writing code while Kubernetes handles the underlying infrastructure. Kubernetes uses declarative configuration files to specify the desired state of an application, and can automatically scale applications based on demand, handle failovers, and manage networking and storage. It is widely used in cloud-native architectures that rely on microservices and containers for production deployments.
