# Deploying your First Application

To deploy your first application in Kubernetes, you need to create a deployment and service manifest in YAML files, apply the manifests to your Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl apply command, verify that your application's pods are running with kubectl get pods, and test the service with kubectl get services and accessing the service using a web browser or a tool like cURL. There are also various tools and platforms available that can simplify application deployment in Kubernetes, such as Helm charts and Kubernetes operators.
