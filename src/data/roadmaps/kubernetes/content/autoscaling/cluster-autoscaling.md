# Cluster Autoscaling

Cluster Autoscaling is a feature in Kubernetes that automatically scales the cluster based on node resource utilization. It monitors the utilization of nodes and creates or removes nodes accordingly to ensure the appropriate amount of resources are available to handle the workload while minimizing costs. There are different approaches to implementing Cluster Autoscaling, such as using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler or Cluster Autoscaler. It's useful in scenarios with highly variable workloads, ensuring applications remain responsive and available without manual adjustments to the cluster size.
