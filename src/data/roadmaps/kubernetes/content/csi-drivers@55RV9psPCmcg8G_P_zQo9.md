# CSI drivers

CSI (Container Storage Interface) drivers in Kubernetes provide a standard way for storage providers to integrate with Kubernetes and offer persistent storage for containerized applications. They operate as separate containerized processes and communicate with Kubernetes through a well-defined API. CSI drivers allow Kubernetes to access a wide range of storage systems and provide advanced features like snapshotting and cloning.
