# Running Applications

Running applications involves deploying and managing software within a Kubernetes cluster. This includes packaging the application, defining its resource requirements (like CPU and memory), specifying how it should be exposed to the outside world, and ensuring it remains healthy and available. It also covers scaling the application to handle varying workloads and updating it without downtime.
