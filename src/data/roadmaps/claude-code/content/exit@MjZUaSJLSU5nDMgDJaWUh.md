# /exit

The `/exit` command is a built-in utility used to safely terminate your current Claude Code session and return you to your standard terminal prompt. Unlike force-quitting the application, using this command ensures that the system performs a clean shutdown, which includes saving your conversation history and updating any local session metadata so that you can resume your work later using the `claude -c` flag.
