# Claude CLI

Claude Code CLI is a command-line tool that acts as an agentic AI coding partner by interacting directly with your local files and terminal. To set it up, you first need an active Claude subscription or an Anthropic Console account. On macOS or Linux, you can install it by running a simple command in your terminal (curl -fsSL [https://claude.ai/install.sh](https://claude.ai/install.sh) | bash), while Windows users can use PowerShell (irm [https://claude.ai/install.ps1](https://claude.ai/install.ps1) | iex). Once installed, navigate to your project folder, type claude to start a session, and follow the prompts to log in via your browser. From there, you can ask questions or give instructions, and the assistant will propose specific code changes for you to review and approve
