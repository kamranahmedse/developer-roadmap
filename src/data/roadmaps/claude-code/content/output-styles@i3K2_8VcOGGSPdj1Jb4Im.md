# Output Styles

Claude Code allows you to switch between different output styles to adapt the agent’s persona and verbosity to your specific needs, effectively modifying its core system prompt. Beyond the standard coding mode, you can use built-in styles like Explanatory, which provides educational insights into implementation choices, or Learning, a collaborative mode where Claude places `TODO(human)` markers to encourage hands-on contribution. You can toggle these via the `/output-style` command or create custom output styles by placing Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in your `.claude/output-styles` directory, allowing you to define entirely new behaviors or specialized non-engineering personas.
