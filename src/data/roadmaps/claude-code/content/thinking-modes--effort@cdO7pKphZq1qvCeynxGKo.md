# Thinking modes & Effort

Using thinking modes and adjusting effort levels in Claude Code is essential for balancing deep reasoning with operational efficiency. By defaulting to Plan Mode for complex tasks, you force Claude to perform "reconnaissance before the raid," allowing it to research your architecture and draft a structured strategy before touching any source code. This approach significantly reduces "vibe-coding" errors and hallucinations, as the model can analyze dependencies without the risk of accidental modifications. Furthermore, you can fine-tune Claude's cognitive energy using the effort parameter (available through the /model command); higher effort levels trigger "extended thinking" or "ultrathink," which use more test-time compute to solve multifaceted logic or debugging puzzles, while lower effort levels optimize for speed and cost on simpler tasks. This "measure twice, cut once" philosophy ensures that Claude remains a precise architectural partner rather than just a code generator, ultimately saving you time and money by getting complex implementations right on the first attempt.
