# CLAUDE.md

CLAUDE.md is a project-specific markdown file that acts as the "persistent memory" and onboarding manual for Claude Code, ensuring the AI adheres to your unique development standards across every session. Since Claude begins each new interaction with a blank context, this file is automatically read at launch to provide essential project "WHY, WHAT, and HOW"—including your tech stack, directory structure, preferred coding patterns (e.g., "Use functional React components"), and exact shell commands for building or testing. By maintaining this document in your project root or `.claude/` directory, you eliminate the need to repeat basic instructions in your prompts, significantly reduce "hallucinations" or stylistic drift, and keep the AI aligned with your team's specific conventions. You can quickly bootstrap a custom version by running the `/init` command, which analyzes your repository to detect frameworks and suggest a baseline configuration.
