# claude -c

The `claude -c` command (short for --continue) is a CLI flag used to instantly reopen the most recent conversation session in your current directory. Instead of starting a fresh chat with a clean context, this command restores the previous conversation history, allowing you to pick up exactly where you left off without having to re-explain your project’s state or repeat previous instructions.
