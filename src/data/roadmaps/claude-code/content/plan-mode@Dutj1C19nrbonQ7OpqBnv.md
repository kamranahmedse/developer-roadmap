# Plan Mode

Plan Mode is a strictly read-only permission state that allows Claude to analyze your codebase, research dependencies, and draft a step-by-step implementation strategy without the risk of modifying any files or executing state-changing commands. It is essentially an "architectural phase" where Claude uses search and analysis tools to build a deep mental model of your project, culminating in a detailed plan for your review before a single line of code is written. You can access the plan by typing `Ctrl+G`. You should use Plan Mode when tackling complex refactors, exploring unfamiliar repositories, or designing new features with multiple moving parts, as it forces a "think-before-you-act" workflow that prevents costly mistakes and ensures the AI fully understands the project's constraints.
