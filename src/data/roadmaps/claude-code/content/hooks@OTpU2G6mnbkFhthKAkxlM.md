# /hooks

The `/hooks` command opens an interactive management menu for configuring automated workflows that trigger at specific points in the Claude Code lifecycle. While features like `CLAUDE.md` provide "soft" instructions, hooks offer deterministic control, ensuring that specific shell commands or AI evaluations run every single time a certain event occurs—such as formatting code after an edit or sending a notification when Claude needs your attention.
