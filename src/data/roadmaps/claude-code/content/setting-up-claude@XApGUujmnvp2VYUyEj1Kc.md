# Setting up Claude Code

To set up Claude Code, you first install the CLI tool through your terminal using a single command tailored to your operating system. For macOS, Linux, or WSL, you run `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`, while Windows users can use PowerShell to run `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex`. Once the installation is complete, you navigate to any code project directory and type `claude`, which will trigger a one-time login process where you authenticate using your Claude.ai account or an Anthropic Console API key. After logging in, the tool is ready to use immediately; it will automatically index your project files and await your natural language instructions to start coding, debugging, or running terminal commands.
