# Skills

In Claude Code, Skills are self-contained folders of "expert knowledge" and repeatable workflows that Claude loads dynamically into its context only when the task requires it. Each skill is anchored by a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter—which helps Claude identify the skill's purpose without bloating the context window—and a body of specific instructions, often accompanied by supporting scripts, assets, or reference documents. While `CLAUDE.md` provides permanent project context, skills are designed for progressive disclosure, acting as on-demand "expert modes" for specialized actions like auditing security, formatting complex documentation, or orchestrating multi-step deployment pipelines. You can trigger them manually using a slash command (e.g., `/deploy`) or let Claude autonomously invoke them when it detects a match with a skill's description, ensuring the AI maintains high precision and follows "non-negotiable" procedures without the overhead of keeping every rule in its immediate memory at once.
