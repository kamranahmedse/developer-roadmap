# Haiku

Claude Haiku is the fastest and most cost-effective model in the Claude family, specifically engineered for high-speed, high-volume tasks that require near-instant responsiveness. It provides a compact but powerful solution for real-time applications like customer service chatbots, rapid data extraction, and moderating large content streams where low latency is critical. Despite its smaller size, it includes advanced features such as extended thinking, a large token context window, and sophisticated vision capabilities for analyzing charts and diagrams. In complex development environments, it is frequently used as a "sub-agent" to handle repetitive background operations—like scanning logs, generating documentation, or running quick tests—allowing larger models to focus on more difficult architectural problems without slowing down the overall workflow.
