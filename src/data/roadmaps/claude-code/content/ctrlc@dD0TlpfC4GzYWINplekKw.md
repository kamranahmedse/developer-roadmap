# Ctrl+C

`Ctrl+C` is a keyboard shortcut that immediately sends an interrupt signal to the Claude Code terminal to stop its current activity. It is primarily used to halt a long-running process, such as an accidental infinite loop in your code, a search that is taking too long, or a lengthy model response that you realized was going in the wrong direction. This provides a manual "kill switch" that is essential for maintaining control over the agent's actions and preventing the unnecessary consumption of tokens and time.
