# Understand Claude Pricing

Claude Code offers a flexible, dual-path pricing model designed to accommodate both individual power users and high-scale enterprise teams. You can access the tool through a fixed-rate subscription (such as the Pro or Max plans), which provides a generous recurring allocation of messages shared across the web interface and the terminal, making costs predictable for daily development. Alternatively, you can use a pay-as-you-go API model, where you are billed based on the total number of "tokens" (small units of text) processed in each interaction. In this model, costs are split into input charges for the code and instructions you send, and output charges for the code Claude generates.
