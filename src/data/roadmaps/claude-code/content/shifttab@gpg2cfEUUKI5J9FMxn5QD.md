# Shift+Tab

`Shift+Tab` is a navigation shortcut that allows you to cycle through different permission modes to control how much autonomy the AI assistant has over your computer. These modes act as a security dial, ranging from Default Mode, where the assistant must ask for your approval before making any file edits or running terminal commands, to Auto-Accept Mode, which grants it the power to modify files automatically while still prompting for shell commands. Additionally, the cycle includes Plan Mode, a specialized read-only state that restricts the assistant to searching and analyzing your codebase without the ability to change any files or execute code. By toggling these modes on the fly, you can switch from a highly controlled "safety-first" workflow for critical system files to a high-speed, autonomous mode for repetitive tasks like styling or unit testing.
