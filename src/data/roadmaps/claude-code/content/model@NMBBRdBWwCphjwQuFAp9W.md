# /model

The `/model` command is a switcher utility that allows you to change which large language model (LLM) is powering your current session without restarting the application. This is particularly useful for cost-performance optimization; you can use a high-intelligence model like Claude Sonnet for complex architectural planning and then switch to a faster, cheaper model like Claude Haiku for repetitive tasks like writing boilerplate code or unit tests.
