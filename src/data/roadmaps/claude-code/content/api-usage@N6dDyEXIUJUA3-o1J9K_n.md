# API Usage

Claude Console authentication uses a pay-as-you-go model where the tool connects directly to the Anthropic API using a personal API key rather than a flat-rate monthly subscription. To set this up, you must first create an account at the Claude Console, generate a secret API key, and ensure you have a balance of credits in your account. This mode is ideal for power users or developers who prefer to pay only for the specific amount of data—or tokens—processed during their coding sessions. Because this connection communicates directly with the API, it also allows you to choose specific model versions and provides more granular control over your billing and usage thresholds.
