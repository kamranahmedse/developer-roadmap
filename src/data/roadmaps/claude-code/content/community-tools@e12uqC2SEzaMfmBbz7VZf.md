# Community Tools

Community tools extend the capabilities of Claude Code by integrating it with external platforms through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and specialized plugins. These integrations allow the assistant to interact directly with services like GitHub for managing pull requests, Slack for sending project updates, and Jira or Linear for tracking issues. Beyond official offerings, the community has developed numerous third-party extensions—such as Claude Trace for observability and Gemini CLI for cross-model reviews—which can be easily added via the `/plugin` command to tailor the assistant's skills to your specific team’s tech stack and workflow.
