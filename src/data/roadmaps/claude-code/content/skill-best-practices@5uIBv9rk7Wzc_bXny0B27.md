# Skill Best Practices

When configuring Claude Code skills, the primary best practice is to optimize for discoverability and context efficiency by using precise YAML frontmatter and "lazy loading." Your skill's `description` should act as a clear semantic trigger, using specific keywords that help Claude identify exactly when to activate the expert instructions without bloating the context window of every conversation. Structure the `SKILL.md` with a narrow, modular focus rather than creating a "Swiss Army Knife" skill; if a workflow has non-negotiable side effects, use `disable-model-invocation: true` to ensure it only runs when manually triggered via a slash command. Additionally, leverage argument placeholders (like `$ARGUMENTS`) to make your skills reusable across different files, and store them in the project’s `.claude/skills/` directory so they are version-controlled and shared with your team. Finally, keep skill instructions deterministic by providing step-by-step tool sequences, which ensures Claude follows your project’s "golden path" for complex tasks like deployments or security audits.
