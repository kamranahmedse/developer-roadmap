# /cost

The `/cost` command is a financial monitoring tool that provides a real-time snapshot of the monetary expenses and token usage for your active session. While the `/usage` command focuses on how much of your context window is occupied, /cost translates that activity into USD amounts, showing you exactly how much your current conversation has cost based on your API pricing tier.
