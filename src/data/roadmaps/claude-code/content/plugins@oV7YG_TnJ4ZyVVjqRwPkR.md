# Plugins

Claude Code plugins are shareable packages that bundle multiple customizations—including slash commands, specialized agents, skills, hooks, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers—into a single installable unit. They serve as a standardized way to distribute complex AI workflows across different projects or within an engineering team, ensuring that every developer has access to the same tools and coding standards. Each plugin is organized around a `plugin.json` manifest file that defines its metadata and components, and its features are typically namespaced to avoid command conflicts. You can discover and install pre-built plugins from official or community marketplaces using the `/plugin` command, or create your own by packaging local `.claude/` configurations into a versioned directory structure.
