# Commo Usecases

Claude Code can be used for a wide range of professional software development tasks, from legacy system modernization and large-scale refactoring to rapid prototyping for startups. Organizations use it to navigate and modernize massive codebases containing millions of lines of code, while data science teams employ it to convert exploratory research from notebooks into production-ready data pipelines. In daily engineering workflows, it is frequently applied to automate unit testing, diagnose complex bugs using stack traces, and manage dependency upgrades across entire repositories. Additionally, it has become a powerful tool for infrastructure automation, where DevOps teams use it to manage Kubernetes clusters, configure monitoring systems, and build CI/CD pipelines through natural language instructions.
