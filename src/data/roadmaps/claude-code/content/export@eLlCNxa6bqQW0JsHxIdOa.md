# /export

The `/export` command is a data utility that allows you to save your entire current conversation history into a single file on your local machine. This command generates a Markdown-formatted document containing all your prompts, the AI's responses, and the results of any code changes or terminal commands executed during the session. It is designed for documentation and knowledge sharing, enabling you to archive successful debugging sessions, create project reports, or share a complex implementation logic with teammates who do not have access to your local terminal history.
