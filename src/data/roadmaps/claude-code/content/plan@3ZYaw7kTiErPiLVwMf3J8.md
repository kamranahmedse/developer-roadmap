# /plan

Plan Mode is a read-only environment that allows the AI to research, analyze, and outline a multi-step strategy for a task without making any actual changes to your files or executing state-altering commands. When you enter this mode—either by typing `/plan` or pressing `Shift+Tab`—the assistant focuses on gathering context and identifying dependencies to create a detailed implementation document. This serves as a safety gate where you can review and edit the proposed approach (using `Ctrl+G` to open the plan file) before giving the final approval to transition into an execution mode to apply the changes.
