# Creating Custom Skills

To create a custom skill in Claude Code, you must establish a new folder within the `.claude/skills/` directory containing a `SKILL.md` file that defines the skill's identity and logic. This file begins with a YAML frontmatter block containing a unique `name` and a detailed `description`—which Claude uses as a trigger to "know" when to activate the skill—and can include an optional `disable-model-invocation: true` flag if you want the skill to run as a manual, deterministic workflow rather than an autonomous one. The body of the Markdown file acts as a specialized system prompt, where you provide step-by-step instructions, define argument placeholders like `$ARGUMENTS`, and list the specific tool sequences Claude should follow to complete the task. By organizing your skill this way, you allow Claude to maintain a lean context window, loading these expert instructions only when you explicitly call them via a slash command (e.g., `/my-skill-name`) or when Claude Code detects a task that matches the skill’s documented purpose.
