# Creating Subagents

To create a Subagent in Claude Code, you must define a specialized assistant within a Markdown file located in the `.claude/agents/` directory, using YAML frontmatter to specify its `name`, `description`, `model`, and a restricted set of `tools`. This isolated architecture is most effective when you need to delegate "high-context" tasks—like searching through dozens of files for architectural patterns or performing a security audit—because the subagent operates in its own context window, returning only a summarized result to your main session to save tokens and prevent "distraction." For best results, use a descriptive trigger in the YAML header so the main agent knows when to autonomously invoke it, and strictly limit the subagent's tools (e.g., providing only `Read` and `Grep` for a "Reviewer" agent) to create a safe, read-only layer of expertise. You can also optimize for cost by assigning Claude Haiku to simple subagent tasks like linting, while reserving sonnet for the main reasoning loop.
