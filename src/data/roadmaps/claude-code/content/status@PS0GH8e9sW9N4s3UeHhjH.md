# /status

The `/status` command is an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of your current session's health and system configuration. Unlike the `/statusline` command, which places a permanent information bar at the bottom of your terminal, `/status` opens a temporary, tabbed interface that displays detailed metrics such as your Claude Code version, the specific AI model in use, active account details, and real-time usage limits. It is designed for one-off checks to verify connection stability or to monitor your daily and weekly token quotas before starting a large coding task.
