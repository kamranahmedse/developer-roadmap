# /memory

The `/memory` command is a knowledge management tool used to create and manage persistent information that survives across different Claude Code sessions. Unlike the `/compact` command, which only optimizes the current conversation's temporary window, `/memory` interacts with permanent storage—primarily your project's CLAUDE.md file and a hidden auto-memory directory. When you run this command, it typically opens your system's default text editor, allowing you to manually refine the coding standards, architectural decisions, and project-specific patterns that Claude should "remember" every time you launch the tool in that directory.
