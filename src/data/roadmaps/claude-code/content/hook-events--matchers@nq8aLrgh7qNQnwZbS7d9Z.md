# Hook Events & Matchers

In Claude Code, Hook Events represent the specific lifecycle moments when custom logic can be triggered, while Matchers act as the regex-based filters that determine which specific actions within those moments should fire the hook. Events cover every phase of the agentic loop, from session initialization (`SessionStart`) and user input (`UserPromptSubmit`) to the execution gates before and after a tool is used (`PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse`). Matchers are primarily used with tool-based events to target specific capabilities; for example, a matcher of `Bash` targets shell commands, while `Edit|Write` targets file modifications. If a matcher is omitted or set to `*`, the hook triggers for every occurrence of that event. By combining these, you can create precise guardrails—such as a `PreToolUse` hook with a `Bash` matcher to block `rm -rf` commands, or a `PostToolUse` hook with an `Edit` matcher to auto-format code only after a file has been modified—ensuring that your automation is both powerful and token-efficient.
