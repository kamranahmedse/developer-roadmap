# Hooks

Hooks are automated triggers that execute specific scripts or commands at key points in the AI's workflow, such as before or after the assistant performs a task. These hooks allow developers to enforce project standards and ensure system reliability without manual intervention, much like Git hooks but designed for an AI-driven development cycle. For example, a "pre-edit" hook can automatically back up a file before the AI touches it, while a "post-task" hook can trigger a code formatter or run a specific test suite to verify that the AI's changes didn't break anything. By configuring these in your project's settings, you create a safety net that ensures the AI assistant remains compliant with your local environment's rules and development lifecycle every time it operates.
