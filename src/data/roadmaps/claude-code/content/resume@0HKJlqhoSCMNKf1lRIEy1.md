# Resume Conversations

To resume a conversation in Claude Code, you can use the terminal command `claude --continue` (or `-c`) to instantly pick up the most recent session in your current directory, or `claude --resume` (or `-r`) to open an interactive session picker. This picker allows you to browse past conversations—complete with metadata like the Git branch, message count, and a preview of the task—and select one using your arrow keys and the Enter key. If you know a specific session ID, you can bypass the menu by running `claude --resume <session_id>`. Once inside a session, you can also use the `/resume` slash command to switch between conversations without exiting the tool. These features restore the full context of your work, including message history, tool results, and the exact state of your code, ensuring you never have to re-explain your project structure after an interruption.
