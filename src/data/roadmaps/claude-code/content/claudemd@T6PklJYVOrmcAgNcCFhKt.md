# CLAUDE.md

`CLAUDE.md` is a configuration file placed in a project's root directory that provides the AI assistant with specific rules, project context, and custom instructions for that particular codebase. It acts as a set of persistent guidelines that the AI reads at the start of every session to ensure its code suggestions align with your project's coding standards, tech stack, and architectural patterns. By defining your preferred naming conventions, testing frameworks, or known edge cases within this file, you can maintain consistency across a team and prevent the assistant from making repetitive mistakes. This file is particularly useful for documenting complex workflows or "gotchas" that are unique to your local environment, effectively acting as a specialized instruction manual for the AI.
