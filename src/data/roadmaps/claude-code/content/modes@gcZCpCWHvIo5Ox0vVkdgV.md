# Modes

Permission modes are settings that control the level of autonomy the AI has when interacting with your computer. By default, the system operates in Default Mode, where it must ask for your approval before it edits any files or executes shell commands. You can cycle through other levels of authority, such as Accept-Edits Mode, which allows the AI to modify files automatically while still prompting you for terminal commands, or Plan Mode, which restricts the AI to read-only tools so it can research and outline a strategy without making any actual changes. For advanced workflows, specialized states like Delegate Mode exist to limit a "lead" agent to coordinating other sub-agents, while the high-risk Bypass-Permissions Mode removes all approval prompts entirely for use in secure, isolated environments.
