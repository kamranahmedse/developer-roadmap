# Claude Code Security

Claude Code Security is a new feature built into Claude Code that scans your codebase for security vulnerabilities and suggests fixes for your team to review. Every finding goes through a verification process before it reaches you, with severity ratings so you know what to fix first. Nothing gets changed automatically; Claude suggests the fix, but a human always approves it. It is currently available as a limited research preview for Enterprise and Team customers, with free access for open-source maintainers.
