# Esc Command

The `Esc` key is a navigation shortcut used to exit current menus, cancel active inputs, or clear the command line. If you are in the middle of typing a long prompt and want to start over, pressing Esc will wipe the input field clean, and if you have a dropdown menu or a multi-select list open—such as when choosing files to add to context—it will close that menu without making a selection. This shortcut provides a quick way to reset your immediate interface state without interrupting the underlying AI process or closing the terminal session entirely.
