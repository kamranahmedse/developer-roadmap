# PostToolUse

The `PostToolUse` hook is a reactive lifecycle event that triggers immediately after a tool (like Bash, Write, Edit, or a custom MCP tool) successfully completes its execution. While the `PreToolUse` hook acts as a guard to block actions, the `PostToolUse` hook is designed for automation, cleanup, and quality control—ensuring that every action Claude takes adheres to your project's standards.
