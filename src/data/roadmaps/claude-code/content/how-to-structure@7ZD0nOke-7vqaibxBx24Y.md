# How to Structure CLAUDE.md

To write an effective CLAUDE.md, you should treat it as a concise, persistent "source of truth" that provides Claude with the project-specific context it cannot infer from the code alone. According to the official best practices, the file should be kept short and human-readable, focusing on non-obvious information like unique bash commands for building and testing, repository-specific code styles (e.g., "Use ES modules, not CommonJS"), and architectural decisions. You should strictly exclude anything Claude can figure out by reading the code, standard language conventions, or self-evident advice like "write clean code," as a bloated file causes the model to ignore your actual instructions. Structure the document with clear headings and use the `@path/to/file` syntax to import external documentation (like `README.md` or `package.json`) to keep the core CLAUDE.md lean. Treat the file like code: refine it over time using the `/init` command to bootstrap a version, prune it regularly to ensure high adherence, and commit it to Git so your entire team benefits from the shared context.
