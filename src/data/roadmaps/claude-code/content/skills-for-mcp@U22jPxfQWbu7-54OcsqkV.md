# Skills for MCP

Skills act as structured, reusable knowledge packages that dramatically improve how Claude interacts with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers by giving it precise, context-aware instructions for specific tools and workflows. Rather than relying on Claude to infer how to use a given MCP server from scratch each time, skills provide curated guidance — best practices, common patterns, error handling strategies, and domain-specific context — that help Claude make smarter, more reliable decisions when invoking tools, chaining calls, and interpreting results.
