# /help

The `/help` command is an interactive directory that provides a comprehensive list of all available slash commands, keyboard shortcuts, and system features. When you type it, Claude Code displays a searchable guide that explains how to use tools such as context management, file mentions, and permission modes. It is designed to be a quick-access manual that helps you discover advanced functionality or refresh your memory of syntax without leaving your terminal or consulting external documentation.
