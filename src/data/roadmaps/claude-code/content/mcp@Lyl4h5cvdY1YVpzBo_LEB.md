# /mcp

The `/mcp` command is the integration hub for the Model Context Protocol, an open standard that connects Claude Code to external data sources and third-party tools. While you use the terminal command `claude mcp add` to install a new server, the `/mcp` slash command is used inside the session to manage those connections, authorize permissions, and view the specific capabilities (tools) available to the AI.
