# Multiline input ()

Multiline input allows you to format complex instructions across several lines without immediately sending the prompt to the AI. The fastest way to create multiline input is by typing `\` followed by `Enter`. This works in all terminals by default and tells the system to treat the next line as a continuation of the current one. However, depending on your terminal and configuration, alternative methods may be available.
