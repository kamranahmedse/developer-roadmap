# Subscription options 

Subscription-based authentication for Claude Code lets you use your existing Claude.ai plan to power your development tasks with a unified login. If you have a Claude Pro or Claude Max account, you can simply run the `claude` command and follow the browser prompt to link your personal subscription, which includes Claude Code usage at no extra cost.  

For companies, the Claude Code on Team plans is designed for smaller, collaborative groups, offering higher usage limits than Pro, while Enterprise provides advanced security (SSO, Audit Logs), deeper integration, and higher capacity for large-scale operations. 

Once logged in, your credentials are stored, and you won’t need to log in again. To switch accounts later, use the `/login` command.
