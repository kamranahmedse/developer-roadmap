# Sonnet

Claude Sonnet is a high-performance large language model that strikes an ideal balance between advanced reasoning intelligence and rapid processing speed. It serves as the versatile "workhorse" of the Claude family, capable of handling complex programming tasks, such as multi-file refactoring and autonomous debugging, while operating significantly faster and more cost-effectively than the top-tier Opus model. With a large token context window and sophisticated vision capabilities, it excels at interpreting technical documentation, analyzing dense data charts, and translating legacy codebases into modern frameworks. Because it offers near-frontier intelligence with the efficiency required for real-time applications, it is the default choice for most professional development workflows and agentic tasks that require consistent, high-quality results without the latency of larger models.
