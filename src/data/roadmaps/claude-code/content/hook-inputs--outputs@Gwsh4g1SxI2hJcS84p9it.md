# Hook Inputs & Outputs

In Claude Code, hooks communicate through a standardized JSON interface where Inputs are passed to the hook via `stdin` and Outputs are returned via `stdout` to influence the agent's next move. The input payload typically includes a `context` object containing session metadata and event-specific data, such as the `tool` name and its arguments (e.g., the exact code being written or command being run). To respond, your hook must output a JSON object: for Command hooks, an exit code of `0` allows the action to proceed, while an exit code of `2` paired with a "reason" string in the output JSON will block the tool and report the failure back to Claude.
