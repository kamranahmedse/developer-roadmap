# claude "query"

The `claude "query"` command allows you to start the Claude Code interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) with an initial instruction already provided. By passing a string as an argument directly after the `claude` command, the assistant will immediately begin processing that request—such as "explain this project" or "fix the lint errors"—the moment the interface loads. This method is more efficient than opening the tool first and typing your request manually, as it combines the startup and the initial task into a single step while still keeping the session open for further conversation and follow-up actions.
