# /config

The `/config` command is the central management tool for customizing your Claude Code experience and fine-tuning how the assistant interacts with your system. Running this command opens an interactive menu—or allows for direct terminal arguments—to modify global and project-specific settings such as default models, theme preferences, and permission levels.
