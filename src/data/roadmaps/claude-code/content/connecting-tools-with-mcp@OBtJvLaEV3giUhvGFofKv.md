# Connecting Tools with MCP

Model Context Protocol (MCP) transforms Claude Code from a local file editor into a connected agent capable of interacting with your entire tech stack, from Jira tickets to live databases. Acting like a "USB-C port for AI," MCP provides a standardized bridge that allows Claude to discover and execute external functions without requiring custom-coded integrations for every service. You can add these capabilities using the interactive `claude mcp add` command or by directly editing your configuration file. This modularity is key to managing your context window; rather than loading every possible tool at once, you can scope specific MCP servers to individual projects or call them on-demand, ensuring Claude has the exact "hands" it needs only when the task requires them.
