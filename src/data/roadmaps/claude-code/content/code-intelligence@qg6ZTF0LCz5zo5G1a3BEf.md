# Code Intelligence Plugin

In Claude Code, Code Intelligence plugins extend the CLI's native search capabilities by integrating with the Language Server Protocol (LSP), granting Claude the same "IDE-level" awareness found in modern editors. By installing language-specific plugins via the `/plugin` command, you enable Claude to perform high-precision navigation—including jumping to definitions, finding references, and listing symbols—rather than relying solely on keyword-based grep searches. These plugins also provide instant diagnostics, allowing Claude to detect and fix type errors or syntax warnings immediately after an edit is made.
