# File Path Mentions (@)

File path mentions, triggered by typing the `@` symbol followed by a filename or folder, allow you to manually point the AI toward specific parts of your codebase. This creates a direct reference that prioritizes those files in the current conversation, ensuring the assistant analyzes the exact code you are interested in without having to search your entire project first. It supports autocomplete, so as you type after the @ symbol, a list of matching files appears, allowing you to quickly select the correct path and add it to the conversation context.
