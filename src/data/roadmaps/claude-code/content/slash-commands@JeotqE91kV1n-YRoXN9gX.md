# Slash Commands (/)

Slash commands are the steering wheel of Claude Code. They allow you to execute meta-actions, manage your session, and configure the environment without needing to write a natural language request. By typing a forward slash / at the start of your prompt, you gain access to a suite of utility tools that help you control costs, manage context, and extend functionality. These commands are processed locally and do not involve the AI's reasoning engine until necessary, making them instant and efficient.
