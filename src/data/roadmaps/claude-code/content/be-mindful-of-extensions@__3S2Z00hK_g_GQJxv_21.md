# Be mindful of extensions

Carefully managing extensions—such as MCP servers, skills, and subagents—is vital because every active integration consumes a portion of Claude’s finite context window, and excessive "context pollution" can lead to degraded reasoning or higher operational costs. While global extensions provide broad utility, they are re-read during every interaction; therefore, it is a best practice to use "lazy loading" by keeping specialized instructions in subdirectory [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) files or on-demand skills that only enter the context when specifically triggered. For high-volume tasks like log analysis or extensive file searches, you should offload the work to subagents, which operate in an isolated context window and return only a concise summary to your main session, effectively shielding your primary conversation from token bloat. By intentionally scoping your tools and disabling those not needed for your current task, you preserve the high-quality "reasoning core" of the model, ensure that critical instructions aren't "lost in the middle," and maximize the value of features like prompt caching to keep your development cycles fast and cost-effective.
