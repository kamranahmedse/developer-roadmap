First step in creating a design system from an existing design is performing a design analysis and understanding what you will be working with to identify the requirements and prepare a plan. Performing the analysis may consist of:

- Understanding the Existing Design Process
- Performing Visual Audit
- Identifying Design Elements
- Identify Common Components
- Understanding the A/B Testing and Experimentation Needs
- Understanding any Locale or regional requirements (such as LTR/RTL).
- Documenting your findings
