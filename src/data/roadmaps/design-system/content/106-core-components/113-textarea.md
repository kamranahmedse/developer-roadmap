# Textarea

Text area lets users enter and edit text.

- **Disabled State:** Prevents input interactions and removes its value from the form submission.
- **Placeholder:** When there’s no value entered, show a placeholder with a potential value example. Don’t use placeholders as labels for the inputs.
- **Label:** There should be a text label linked with the text field. Clicking the label should move the focus to the field.
- **Error State:** The error state is used for form validation errors when the error is related to the text field only. Always use a text error along with changing the colour of the field.
- **Focused State:** The focused state should highlight the text field when users start to interact with it. There is always only one focused field in the form.
