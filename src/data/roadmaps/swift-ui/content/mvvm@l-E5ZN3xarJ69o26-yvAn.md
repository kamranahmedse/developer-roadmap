# MVVM

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is a software architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of concerns in application development. It divides an application into three interconnected parts: the Model (data and business logic), the View (the user interface), and the ViewModel (an intermediary that prepares data for the View and handles user input). This separation makes code more testable, maintainable, and reusable.
