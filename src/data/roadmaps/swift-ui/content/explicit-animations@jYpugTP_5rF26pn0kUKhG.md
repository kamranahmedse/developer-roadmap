# Explicit Animations

Explicit animations involve directly controlling the animation's behavior by specifying its parameters, such as duration, delay, and easing. Instead of relying on implicit transitions triggered by state changes, you define exactly how a view's properties animate from one value to another. This gives you fine-grained control over the animation's appearance and timing, allowing for more complex and customized visual effects.
