# Font Modifier

The `font` modifier in SwiftUI allows you to customize the appearance of text within your views by specifying the typeface, weight, and size. It provides a way to control how text is displayed, enabling you to create visually appealing and consistent user interfaces. You can apply different font styles to various text elements in your app, such as labels, buttons, and text fields, to enhance readability and overall design.
