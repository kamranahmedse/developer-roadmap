# Arithmetic Operators in Swift

Arithmetic operators are special symbols that perform mathematical calculations on values. Swift provides standard arithmetic operators like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). It also includes the remainder operator (%), which calculates the remainder after division. These operators are fundamental for performing calculations and manipulating numerical data within your Swift code.
