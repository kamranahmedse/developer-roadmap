# Asynchronous Functions

Asynchronous functions allow your program to start a potentially long-running task and then continue executing other code without waiting for that task to complete. When the asynchronous task finishes, it can notify your program, which can then process the results. This approach prevents your app from freezing or becoming unresponsive while waiting for operations like network requests or file processing to finish.
