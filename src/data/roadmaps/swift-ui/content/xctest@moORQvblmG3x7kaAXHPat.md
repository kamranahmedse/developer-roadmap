# XCTest

XCTest is Apple's framework for writing unit, integration, and UI tests for your Swift and Objective-C code. It allows developers to verify the correctness of their code by writing assertions that check for expected outcomes. While XCTest has been the standard for iOS testing for a long time, the Swift Testing framework is emerging as a modern alternative, promising a more streamlined and Swift-native approach to testing in the future.
