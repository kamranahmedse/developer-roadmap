# Data Flow

Data flow refers to how data moves and changes within your application. It describes the path data takes from its source, through various components, and ultimately to the user interface. Understanding data flow is crucial for building predictable and maintainable apps, as it helps you manage state and ensure that changes in data are reflected correctly in your UI.
