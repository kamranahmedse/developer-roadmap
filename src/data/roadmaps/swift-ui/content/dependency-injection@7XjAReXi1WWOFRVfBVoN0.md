# Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection is a design pattern where a component receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. This promotes loose coupling, making code more modular, testable, and reusable. Instead of a class being responsible for instantiating the objects it needs, those objects are "injected" into the class, often through its initializer or properties.
