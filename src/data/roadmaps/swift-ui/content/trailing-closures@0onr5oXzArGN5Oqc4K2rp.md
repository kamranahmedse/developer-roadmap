# Trailing Closures

A trailing closure is a closure that's written after the function's parentheses. If a function's last parameter is a closure, you can pass the closure outside of the parentheses when you call the function. This syntax makes the code more readable, especially when the closure is long and complex. It's a syntactic sugar that simplifies how you pass closures as arguments to functions.
