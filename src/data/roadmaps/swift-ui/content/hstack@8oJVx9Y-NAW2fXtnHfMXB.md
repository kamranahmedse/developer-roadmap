# HStack

An `HStack` is a layout container that arranges its child views in a horizontal line. It's like a row where you place different UI elements side-by-side. You can control the spacing between these elements and how they align vertically within the row. `HStack` simplifies creating horizontal layouts without needing to manually calculate positions and sizes.
