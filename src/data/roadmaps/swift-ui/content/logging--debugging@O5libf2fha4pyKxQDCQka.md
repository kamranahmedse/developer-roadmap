# Logging & Debugging

Logging and debugging are essential practices in software development for identifying and resolving issues in your code. Logging involves recording information about your application's behavior as it runs, allowing you to trace events and diagnose problems. Debugging, on the other hand, is the process of stepping through your code, examining variables, and understanding the flow of execution to pinpoint the source of errors. These techniques help ensure your Swift and SwiftUI applications function correctly and provide a smooth user experience.
