# Property Wrappers

Property wrappers in Swift provide a way to add a layer of code between the property and the code that manages it. They essentially encapsulate code that gets executed when a property is accessed or modified. This allows you to reuse the same property logic across multiple properties, such as enforcing constraints, managing data storage, or providing thread safety.
