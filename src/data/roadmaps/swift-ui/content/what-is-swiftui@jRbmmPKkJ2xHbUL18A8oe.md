# SwiftUI

SwiftUI is a declarative UI framework from Apple that allows developers to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS) using Swift code. Instead of imperatively defining UI elements and their behavior, you describe the desired state of your UI, and SwiftUI automatically handles the rendering and updates. This approach simplifies UI development, promotes code reuse, and enables features such as live previews and hot reloading.
