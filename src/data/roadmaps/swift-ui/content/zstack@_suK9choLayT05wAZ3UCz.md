# ZStack

ZStack is a layout container that overlays views on top of each other, aligning them in both the horizontal and vertical axes. The views are stacked in the order they are declared, with the last view in the code appearing on top. This allows you to create layered effects, such as placing text over an image or creating custom button styles with multiple layers.
