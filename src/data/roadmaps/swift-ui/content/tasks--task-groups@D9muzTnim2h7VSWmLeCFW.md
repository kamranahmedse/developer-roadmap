# Tasks & Task Groups

Tasks in Swift's concurrency model represent units of work that can be executed concurrently. Task Groups allow you to create and manage collections of child tasks, enabling you to perform parallel operations and aggregate their results. This provides a structured way to break down complex operations into smaller, manageable, and concurrent units, improving performance and responsiveness in your applications.
