# Animations

Animations allow you to visually enhance your app's user interface by creating smooth transitions and dynamic effects. They involve changing properties of views over time, making your app feel more responsive and engaging. You can animate things like size, position, opacity, and color, adding a layer of polish and feedback to user interactions.
