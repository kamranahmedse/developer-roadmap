# Result Builders

Result builders in Swift provide a way to build up data structures, like views in SwiftUI, using a sequence of statements. They essentially transform a series of expressions into a single value, often an array or a more complex data structure. This allows you to write more declarative and readable code, especially when dealing with complex view hierarchies or data transformations.
