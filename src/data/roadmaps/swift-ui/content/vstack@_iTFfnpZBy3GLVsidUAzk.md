# VStack

A `VStack` is a layout container that arranges its child views in a vertical line. It's like stacking building blocks on top of each other. You can use it to group related UI elements, such as text labels, images, and buttons, so they appear one above the other on the screen. `VStack` automatically manages the positioning and sizing of its children within the vertical stack.
