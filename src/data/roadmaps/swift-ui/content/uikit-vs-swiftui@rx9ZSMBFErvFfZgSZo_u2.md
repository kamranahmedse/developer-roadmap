# UIKit vs. SwiftUI

UIKit and SwiftUI are both frameworks for building user interfaces on Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS). UIKit is the older, imperative framework that has been around since the first iPhone was introduced. SwiftUI is a newer, declarative framework introduced in 2019 that offers a more modern and concise way to design and develop user interfaces. The key difference lies in how you describe the UI: UIKit uses code to directly manipulate views, while SwiftUI describes the desired state of the UI, and the system handles the updates.
