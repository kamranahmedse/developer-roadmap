# TabView

TabView allows you to create an interface with multiple distinct views, each accessible through a tab bar at the bottom (or top, depending on the platform). It's a container view that manages a collection of child views, presenting one at a time based on the user's tab selection. Each tab can be associated with an image and text label, providing a clear and intuitive way for users to navigate between different sections of your app.
