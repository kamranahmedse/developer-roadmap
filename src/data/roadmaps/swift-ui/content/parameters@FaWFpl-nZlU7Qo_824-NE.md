# Parameters in Swift Functions and Closures

Parameters are named values that you pass into a function or closure when you call it. They act as inputs, allowing the function or closure to operate on specific data.  Each parameter has a name and a type, and you specify these in the function or closure's definition. When calling the function or closure, you provide arguments that correspond to these parameters, allowing you to customize the behavior of the code being executed.
