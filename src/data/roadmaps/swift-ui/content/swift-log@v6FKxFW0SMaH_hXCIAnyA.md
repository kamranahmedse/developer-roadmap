# Swift-Log

`swift-log` is a logging API for Swift that provides a standardized way to record messages from your code. It allows you to capture information about your application's behavior, errors, and performance, making it easier to diagnose issues and understand how your code is running. With `swift-log`, you can configure different logging levels (such as debug, info, warning, and error) and direct the output to various destinations, including the console, files, or external logging services.
