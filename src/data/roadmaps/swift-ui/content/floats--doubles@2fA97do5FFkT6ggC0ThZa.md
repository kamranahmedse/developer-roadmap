# Floats and Doubles

Floats and Doubles are fundamental data types in Swift used to represent numbers with fractional components (decimal numbers). A `Float` represents a 32-bit floating-point number, offering a balance between memory usage and precision. A `Double` represents a 64-bit floating-point number, providing greater precision than `Float` but requiring more memory. You would use these when you need to represent values like prices, measurements, or any other non-integer quantity.
