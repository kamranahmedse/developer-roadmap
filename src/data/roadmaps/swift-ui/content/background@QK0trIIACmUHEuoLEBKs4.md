# Background View Modifier

The `background` view modifier in SwiftUI allows you to set a background for a view. This background can be a color, a shape, or even another view. It's applied behind the content of the view it modifies, effectively layering content on top of the background you specify. You can customize the appearance of the background, such as its color, shape, and how it fills the available space.
