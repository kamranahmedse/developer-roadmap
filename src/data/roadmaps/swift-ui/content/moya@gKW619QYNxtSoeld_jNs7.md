# Moya

Moya is a Swift networking library that simplifies the process of making API requests. It acts as an abstraction layer on top of URLSession, providing a cleaner and more organized way to define and manage your API endpoints. Instead of directly dealing with URLs, HTTP methods, and request parameters, you define your API as a set of "targets" (enums) that encapsulate all the necessary information for each request. This approach promotes code reusability, testability, and overall maintainability when working with network communication in your Swift applications.
