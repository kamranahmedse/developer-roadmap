# Switch/Case Statements

A `switch` statement allows you to control which block of code is executed based on the value of a variable or expression. It compares the value against several possible cases, and executes the code associated with the first matching case. Unlike some other languages, Swift's `switch` statements don't require a `break` statement after each case; execution automatically stops after the code for a matching case is run.
