# Grid

A Grid is a layout container that arranges views in a two-dimensional grid, similar to a table. It allows you to organize content into rows and columns, providing a structured way to display information and create complex layouts. You can customize the appearance and behavior of the grid by specifying the number of columns, row spacing, column spacing, and alignment of the views within the grid cells.
