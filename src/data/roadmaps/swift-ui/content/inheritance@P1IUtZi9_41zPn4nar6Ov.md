# Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming where a new class (called a subclass or derived class) can inherit properties and methods from an existing class (called a superclass or base class). This allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, where subclasses inherit and extend the functionality of their superclasses, promoting code reuse and establishing relationships between different types of objects.
