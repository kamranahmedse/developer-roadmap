# Print & String Interpolation

In Swift, `print()` is a function used to display values in the console, which helps debug and see the output of your code. String interpolation allows you to embed variables or expressions directly within a string. You do this by wrapping the variable or expression in parentheses preceded by a backslash: `\(variableName)`. This makes it easy to create dynamic strings that include the values of variables or the results of calculations.
