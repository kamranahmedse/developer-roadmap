# Function Types

In Swift, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be treated like any other data type. A function type describes the parameters a function accepts and the type of value it returns. This allows you to assign functions to variables, pass them as arguments to other functions, and return them as values from functions, providing a powerful way to abstract and reuse code.
