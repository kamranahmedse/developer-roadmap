# Generics

Generics allow you to write flexible and reusable code that can work with any type. Instead of writing separate functions or structs for each data type you want to support, you can define a single function or struct that works with a placeholder type. This placeholder type is then specified when the function or struct is used, making your code more adaptable and less repetitive.
