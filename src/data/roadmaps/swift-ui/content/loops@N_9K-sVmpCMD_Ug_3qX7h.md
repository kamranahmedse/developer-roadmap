# Loops

Loops are fundamental programming constructs that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. They provide a way to automate repetitive tasks, iterate over collections of data, and perform actions until a specific condition is met. In Swift, you'll primarily encounter `for-in` loops for iterating over sequences and `while` loops for repeating code based on a condition.
