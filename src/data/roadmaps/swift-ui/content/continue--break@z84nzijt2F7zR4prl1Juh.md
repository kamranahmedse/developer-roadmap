# Continue & Break in Swift Loops

In Swift, `continue` and `break` are control flow statements used within loops (like `for`, `while`, and `repeat-while`) to alter their execution. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. The `break` statement, on the other hand, immediately terminates the entire loop, and the program execution resumes at the next statement after the loop.
