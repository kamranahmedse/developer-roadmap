# Operators in Swift

Operators are special symbols or phrases that you use to check, change, or combine values. Swift supports a variety of operators, from familiar arithmetic operators like `+` and `-`, to more advanced operators for logic and bit manipulation. These operators allow you to perform calculations, make comparisons, and manipulate data within your Swift code.
