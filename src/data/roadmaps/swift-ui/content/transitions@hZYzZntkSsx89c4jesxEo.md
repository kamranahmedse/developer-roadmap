# Transitions

Transitions define how views appear and disappear from the screen. They control the visual effects applied during these changes, allowing you to create smooth and engaging user experiences. You can customize transitions to include effects like fading, sliding, scaling, or even more complex animations, making your app feel polished and responsive.
