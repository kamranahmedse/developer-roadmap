# Asynchronous Sequences

Asynchronous sequences allow you to iterate over a series of values that arrive over time, potentially from different threads or even across a network. Unlike regular sequences, where all elements are immediately available, asynchronous sequences produce elements as they become available, enabling you to handle data streams, network responses, or any other data source that emits values asynchronously. This is particularly useful for managing concurrent operations and building responsive user interfaces.
