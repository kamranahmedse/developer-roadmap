# Repeat...While Loop

The `repeat...while` loop in Swift executes a block of code at least once, and then continues to repeat the block as long as a specified condition is true.  Unlike the `while` loop, which checks the condition *before* executing the code, the `repeat...while` loop checks the condition *after* executing the code. This guarantees that the code block will always run at least once.
