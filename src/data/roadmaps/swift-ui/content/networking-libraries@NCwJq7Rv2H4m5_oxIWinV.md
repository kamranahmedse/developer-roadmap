# Networking Libraries

Networking libraries provide tools and abstractions to simplify the process of making network requests, handling responses, and managing data transfer. They handle tasks like creating URLs, managing connections, serializing data into formats like JSON, and parsing responses, allowing developers to focus on the application logic rather than the low-level details of network communication. These libraries often offer features like asynchronous operations, error handling, and request cancellation, making network operations more robust and easier to manage.
