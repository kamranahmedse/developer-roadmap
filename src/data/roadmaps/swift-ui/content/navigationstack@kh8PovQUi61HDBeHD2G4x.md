# NavigationStack

`NavigationStack` provides a way to manage hierarchical navigation within your app. It allows users to move forward and backward through a stack of views, similar to how you navigate through folders on a computer. Each view pushed onto the stack becomes a new level in the navigation hierarchy, and the `NavigationStack` provides a back button (or gesture) to return to the previous view. This is the modern replacement for `NavigationView`, offering more flexibility and control over navigation.
