# Return Types

In Swift, a return type specifies the kind of data a function or closure sends back to the caller after it has finished executing. If a function performs a calculation or processes data, the return type indicates what type of result you can expect. If a function doesn't return any value, its return type is `Void`, often represented as `()`.
