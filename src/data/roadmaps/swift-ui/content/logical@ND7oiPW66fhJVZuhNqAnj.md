# Logical Operators

Logical operators in Swift allow you to combine or modify Boolean (true/false) values. They are used to create more complex conditions in your code. The primary logical operators are AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`). These operators enable you to control the flow of your program based on multiple conditions being met or not met.
