# Error Handling

Error handling is a mechanism for responding to and recovering from error conditions that your program may encounter during execution. It allows you to gracefully manage unexpected situations, such as invalid input, network failures, or file access issues, preventing your app from crashing and providing a more robust user experience. Swift provides built-in mechanisms to throw, catch, and propagate errors, ensuring that errors are properly addressed at the appropriate level of your code.
