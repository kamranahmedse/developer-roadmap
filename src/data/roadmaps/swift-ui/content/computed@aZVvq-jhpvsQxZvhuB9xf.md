# Computed Properties

Computed properties in Swift provide a way to calculate a value rather than storing it directly. Unlike stored properties, which hold a value in memory, computed properties offer a getter to retrieve a value and an optional setter to indirectly set other properties. This allows you to perform calculations or transformations on other data when accessing or modifying the computed property.
