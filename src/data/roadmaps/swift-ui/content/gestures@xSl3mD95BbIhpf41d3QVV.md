# Gestures

Gestures are actions performed by a user to interact with a device's screen, such as tapping, swiping, pinching, or rotating. They allow users to directly manipulate and control elements within an application, providing a more intuitive and engaging experience. By recognizing and responding to these gestures, developers can create interactive user interfaces that feel natural and responsive.
