# Swift vs. Objective-C

Swift and Objective-C are both programming languages used to develop applications for Apple's operating systems (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS). Objective-C is an older language, built as an extension of C, while Swift is a more modern language designed to be safer, faster, and easier to learn. Swift offers features like type safety, optionals, and a more concise syntax, making it a preferred choice for new Apple platform development.
