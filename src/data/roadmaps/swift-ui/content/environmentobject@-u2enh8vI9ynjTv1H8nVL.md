# @EnvironmentObject

`@EnvironmentObject` allows you to share data across your entire app or specific parts of your view hierarchy without having to manually pass it down through each view. It's a way to make data accessible to any view that needs it, acting like a global state container that SwiftUI manages. This is particularly useful for things like user settings, app configurations, or shared data models.
