# Tuples in Swift

Tuples in Swift are a way to group multiple values into a single compound value. Unlike arrays, the values within a tuple can be of different types. You define a tuple by enclosing the values within parentheses, separated by commas. For example, `(1, "hello", true)` is a tuple containing an integer, a string, and a boolean. You can access the individual values in a tuple either by their position (starting from 0) or by naming the elements when you define the tuple.
