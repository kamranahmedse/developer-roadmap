# Image

`Image` is a fundamental view used to display pictures or graphics within your app's user interface. It allows you to load images from various sources, such as your app's asset catalog, the file system, or even remote URLs, and present them to the user. You can customize the appearance of an `Image` by applying modifiers to control its size, scaling behavior, and other visual properties.
