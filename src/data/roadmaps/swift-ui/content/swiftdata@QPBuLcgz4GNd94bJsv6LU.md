# SwiftData

SwiftData is Apple's modern framework for managing an app's data model and persisting data locally. It provides a declarative and type-safe way to define your data schema, interact with the underlying storage (typically SQLite), and manage relationships between different data entities. SwiftData integrates seamlessly with SwiftUI, making it easy to fetch, display, and modify data directly within your user interface.
