# Integers in Swift

Integers in Swift are whole numbers, meaning they don't have any fractional or decimal parts. They can be positive, negative, or zero. Swift provides different integer types (like `Int`, `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`, `UInt`, `UInt8`, etc.) that vary in the range of values they can store, allowing you to choose the most appropriate type based on the expected size of the number you're working with. The default `Int` type is usually sufficient for most general-purpose integer storage, and its size depends on the platform (typically 32-bit or 64-bit).
