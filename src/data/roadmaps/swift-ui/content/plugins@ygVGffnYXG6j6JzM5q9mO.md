# Swift Package Manager Plugins

Swift Package Manager plugins allow you to extend the build process of your Swift packages with custom tools and scripts. These plugins can automate tasks like code generation, linting, formatting, and other pre-build or post-build operations, streamlining your development workflow and ensuring consistency across your projects. They essentially provide a way to integrate external tools and scripts directly into the Swift build system.
