# Initialization

Initialization is the process of preparing an instance of a class, structure, or enumeration for use. This involves setting an initial value for each stored property on that instance and performing any other setup or initialization required before the new instance is ready. Initializers are special methods that are called when a new instance is created, ensuring that the instance is in a valid and usable state.
