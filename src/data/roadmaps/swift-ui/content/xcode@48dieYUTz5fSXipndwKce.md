Xcode is Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) used for developing software for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for writing, debugging, and testing code, as well as designing user interfaces. Xcode includes a code editor, compiler, debugger, and build system, all integrated into a single application.
