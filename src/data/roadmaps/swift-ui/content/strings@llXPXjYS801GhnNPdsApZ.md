# Strings in Swift

In Swift, a string is a sequence of characters, like letters, numbers, and symbols. It's a fundamental data type used to represent text. You can create strings using string literals (text enclosed in double quotes) or by combining other strings and values. Strings in Swift are Unicode-compliant, meaning they can represent characters from various languages.
