# App Lifecycle

The app lifecycle manages the state and behavior of your application from launch to termination. It's primarily handled through the `@main` attribute, which designates the entry point of your app. The `App` protocol defines the structure of your application, including the initial scene that's displayed to the user. SwiftUI automatically manages the creation and destruction of your app's scenes, responding to system events like activation, deactivation, and backgrounding, allowing you to react to these state changes and manage resources accordingly.
