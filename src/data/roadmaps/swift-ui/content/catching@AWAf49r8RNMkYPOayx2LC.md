# Catching Errors in Swift

Handling errors involves catching potential problems that may occur during code execution. When a function or method can throw an error, you use a `do-catch` block to try executing the code that might fail. If an error is thrown within the `do` block, control is transferred to the `catch` block, allowing you to respond to the error gracefully and prevent your app from crashing, thereby providing a better user experience.
