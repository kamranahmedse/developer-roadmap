# Nested Functions

Nested functions are functions defined inside the body of another function. The outer function is called the enclosing function, and the inner function is the nested function. Nested functions can access variables from their enclosing function's scope, even after the enclosing function has returned, creating a closure. This allows you to encapsulate and organize code, making it more readable and maintainable by keeping related functionality together.
