# Strict Concurrency Checking

Strict concurrency checking is a feature that helps you write safer and more reliable concurrent code. It detects potential data races and other concurrency-related issues at compile time, preventing unexpected behavior and crashes when your app runs. By enforcing rules about how data can be accessed from different threads, it ensures that your concurrent code is predictable and avoids common pitfalls like simultaneous modification of shared resources.
