# DocC

DocC is Apple's documentation compiler that allows developers to create rich, interactive documentation directly from their Swift or Objective-C code. It transforms specially formatted comments within your code into a structured and navigable documentation set, complete with articles, tutorials, and API reference. This helps developers understand how to use your code effectively and efficiently.
