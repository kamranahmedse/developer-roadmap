# SwiftNIO

SwiftNIO is a low-level, cross-platform asynchronous event-driven network application framework. It enables the development of high-performance protocol servers and clients in Swift. It provides building blocks for handling network connections, data transfer, and event processing without blocking the main thread, making it suitable for applications requiring scalability and responsiveness.
