# While Loops in Swift

A `while` loop in Swift repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The loop checks the condition before each execution of the code block. If the condition is initially false, the code block is never executed. This makes it suitable for situations where you want to repeat a task until a certain condition is met.
