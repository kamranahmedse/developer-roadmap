# Type Safety in Swift

Thanks to type safety, Swift prevents you from accidentally using a value in a way that's not intended. Swift checks the types of your variables and constants during compilation. If you try to assign a value of the wrong type to a variable (like assigning a string to an integer variable), Swift will give you an error. This helps catch mistakes early, making your code more reliable and preventing unexpected behavior at runtime.
