# SwiftUI Inspector

The SwiftUI Inspector is a built-in tool within Xcode that allows developers to examine and modify the properties of SwiftUI views in real-time while an app is running, either in the simulator or on a physical device. It provides a visual interface to inspect the view hierarchy, adjust attributes like colors, fonts, and layout constraints, and immediately see the changes reflected in the app's UI, facilitating rapid prototyping and debugging.
