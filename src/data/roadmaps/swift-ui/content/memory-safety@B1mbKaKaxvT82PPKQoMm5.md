# Memory Safety

Memory safety in Swift is a set of language features that prevent common programming errors related to memory access. It ensures that your program accesses memory predictably and safely, preventing issues like accessing memory that has already been deallocated (dangling pointers) or writing outside the bounds of an allocated memory region (buffer overflows). Swift achieves this through features like automatic memory management (ARC), strong typing, and compile-time checks.
