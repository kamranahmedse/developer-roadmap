# Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that emphasizes separation of concerns, making applications more maintainable, testable, and scalable. It achieves this by dividing the application into distinct layers, each with its own specific responsibility and dependencies. The core idea is to keep the business logic independent from the user interface, database, and external frameworks, allowing changes in one area without affecting others.
