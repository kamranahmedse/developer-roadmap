# SDKs for WebAssembly (Wasm)

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling high-performance applications on the web and other environments. SDKs for Wasm allow developers to compile Swift and Swift UI code into Wasm, making it possible to run Swift applications in web browsers or other Wasm-compatible environments, effectively extending the reach of Swift beyond Apple's platforms.
