# Core Data

Core Data is a framework provided by Apple for managing the model layer objects in your application. It's not a database itself, but rather an object graph management and persistence framework. Core Data allows you to treat data as objects, making it easier to work with and manage complex relationships between data entities, and it handles the underlying storage and retrieval of that data.
