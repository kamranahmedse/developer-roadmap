# Views

In Swift and SwiftUI, a View is a fundamental building block for creating user interfaces. It represents a rectangular area on the screen that displays content and responds to user interactions. Views can be simple, like a text label or an image, or complex, composed of multiple nested views arranged in a hierarchy to create intricate layouts. They are the core components you use to design and structure the visual elements of your app.
