# Creating Swift Packages

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Creating a Swift package allows you to bundle your code into reusable modules, making it easy to share and use in other projects. This involves defining the package's structure, specifying dependencies, and building the code into a distributable format.
