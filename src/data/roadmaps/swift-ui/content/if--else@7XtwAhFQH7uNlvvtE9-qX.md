# If / Else Statements

`if` and `else` statements are fundamental control flow structures in Swift that allow your code to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. The `if` statement evaluates a Boolean expression, and if the expression is `true`, the code within the `if` block is executed. Optionally, you can include an `else` block, which will be executed if the `if` condition is `false`. You can also chain multiple conditions together using `else if` to handle more complex scenarios.
