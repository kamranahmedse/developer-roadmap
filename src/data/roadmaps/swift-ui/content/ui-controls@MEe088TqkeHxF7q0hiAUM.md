# UI Controls

UI Controls are the visual building blocks that users interact with in an app's interface. These elements, such as buttons, text fields, sliders, and switches, allow users to input data, trigger actions, and navigate through the application. They provide a way for the user to communicate with the app and for the app to respond accordingly.
