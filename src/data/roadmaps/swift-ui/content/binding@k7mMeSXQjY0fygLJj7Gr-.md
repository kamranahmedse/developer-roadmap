# @Binding

`@Binding` creates a two-way connection between a view and a source of truth that lives elsewhere. It essentially provides a way for a view to read and modify a value that's owned and managed by another view or data structure. When the view modifies the bound value, the original source of truth is automatically updated, and vice versa, ensuring data consistency across your application.
