# Databases

Databases provide a structured way to store and manage data within your Swift applications. They allow you to persist information beyond the app's runtime, meaning data is saved even when the app is closed. This is essential for storing user information, application settings, or any other data that needs to be retained between sessions. You can interact with databases using various frameworks and libraries in Swift, enabling you to create, read, update, and delete data efficiently.
