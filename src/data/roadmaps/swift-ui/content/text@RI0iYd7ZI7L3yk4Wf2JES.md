# Text

`Text` is a fundamental view used to display static, read-only text on the screen. It allows you to present strings, apply formatting like fonts, colors, and styles, and handle localization for different languages. You can use `Text` to create labels, descriptions, headings, and any other textual content within your app's user interface.
