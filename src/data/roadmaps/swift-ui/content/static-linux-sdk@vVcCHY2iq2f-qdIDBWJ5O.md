# Static Linux SDK

A Static Linux SDK allows you to compile Swift code into standalone executables that can run on Linux systems without requiring a full Swift runtime environment to be installed. This is achieved by bundling all necessary Swift libraries and dependencies directly into the executable file, making it self-contained and portable. This approach simplifies deployment and reduces dependency conflicts, as the application carries everything it needs to run.
