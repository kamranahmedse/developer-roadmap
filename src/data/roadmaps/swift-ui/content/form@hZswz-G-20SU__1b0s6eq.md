# Form

In Swift and SwiftUI, a `Form` is a container view that's designed to organize and display input controls, such as text fields, toggles, and pickers. It automatically handles the layout and styling of these controls, making it easier to create structured and user-friendly interfaces for collecting data or configuring settings. Think of it as a pre-built structure that simplifies the process of creating forms in your app.
