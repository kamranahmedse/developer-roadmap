# NavigationLink

`NavigationLink` enables navigation between different views within your app. It acts as a button or tappable element that, when activated, pushes a new view onto the navigation stack, displaying it to the user. This allows you to create hierarchical navigation structures, where users can drill down into more detailed content and then easily return to previous screens.
