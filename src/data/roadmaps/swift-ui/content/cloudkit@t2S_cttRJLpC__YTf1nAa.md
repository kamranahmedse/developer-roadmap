# CloudKit

CloudKit is Apple's cloud storage solution that allows developers to save and retrieve app data in iCloud. It provides a way to store structured data, like records with fields, and binary data, like images or videos, in the cloud. Users can access their data across all their devices logged into the same iCloud account, and you can also create public data that's accessible to all users of your app.
