# Where Swift is used?
For a long time (from the 1980s to 2014), Objective-C was the only way to write software for Apple products. Swift was designed to replace it.

Here is a comparison to help you understand the difference:

| Feature | Objective-C (The Old Way) | Swift (The Modern Way) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **History** | Created in the early 1980s. Based on the C language. | Created in 2014. Built for modern hardware. |
| **Syntax** | Verbose and difficult. Uses lots of brackets `[]` and symbols. | Clean and concise. Uses dot notation `.` and simple English. |
| **Memory Management** | Manual. The developer had to be very careful about memory usage. | **ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).** Swift handles memory automatically. |
| **File Structure** | Requires two files for every class: a Header (`.h`) and Implementation (`.m`). | Requires only one file (`.swift`). |
| **Safety** | Allows "unsafe" code which leads to bugs. | Strict safety checks prevent bugs before compiling. |

**Example Comparison:**
* **Objective-C:** `NSLog(@"Hello, World!");`
* **Swift:** `print("Hello, World!")`

*Note: While Swift is the future, Objective-C is still used in very old codebases that haven't been updated yet.*
