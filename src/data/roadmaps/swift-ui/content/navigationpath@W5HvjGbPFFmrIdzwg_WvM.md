# NavigationPath

`NavigationPath` provides a way to manage the navigation stack programmatically. Instead of relying solely on `NavigationLink` to push views onto the stack, `NavigationPath` allows you to manipulate the navigation history directly. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to navigate based on complex logic, deep linking, or when you want to programmatically control the back button behavior. It essentially acts as a data-driven representation of the navigation stack, enabling you to push, pop, or replace views more dynamically and flexibly.
