# clipShape

`clipShape` in SwiftUI allows you to mask a view, effectively cropping it to a specific shape. Instead of displaying the entire rectangular area of a view, `clipShape` lets you define a shape (like a circle, rectangle with rounded corners, or even a custom shape), and only the portion of the view that falls within that shape will be visible. Anything outside the shape is hidden. This is useful for creating visually appealing designs and focusing attention on specific parts of a view.
