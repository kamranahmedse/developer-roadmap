# Closures

Closures in Swift are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code. Think of them as mini-functions without a name. They're similar to lambdas or anonymous functions in other programming languages, allowing you to define a function-like construct directly where it's needed, often for short, specific tasks. Closures can capture and store references to any constants and variables from the context in which they are defined, which means they can access and modify values from their surrounding scope, even after the original scope has ended.
