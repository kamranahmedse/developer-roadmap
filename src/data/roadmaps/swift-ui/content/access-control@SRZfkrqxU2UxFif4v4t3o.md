# Access Control

Access control lets you restrict which parts of your code can be used and accessed by other parts of your code, or from code in other files and modules. It's like setting permissions on different components of your app, ensuring that sensitive data and internal workings are protected from unintended use or modification. You can specify different access levels, such as `private`, `fileprivate`, `internal`, `public`, and `open`, to control the visibility and accessibility of entities like classes, structures, properties, and functions.
