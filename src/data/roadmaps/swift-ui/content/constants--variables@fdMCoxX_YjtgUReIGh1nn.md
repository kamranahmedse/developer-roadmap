# Constants & Variables

Constants and variables are fundamental building blocks in Swift for storing data. A variable holds a value that can be changed during the execution of a program, while a constant holds a value that, once assigned, cannot be altered. They are declared using the `var` and `let` keywords, respectively, followed by the name you choose for the constant or variable and its data type.
