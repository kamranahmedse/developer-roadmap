# Localization

Localization is the process of adapting your app to different languages, regions, and cultures. This involves translating text, adjusting layouts for different reading directions, and formatting dates, times, and currencies according to local conventions. By localizing your app, you can reach a wider audience and provide a more user-friendly experience for people around the world.
