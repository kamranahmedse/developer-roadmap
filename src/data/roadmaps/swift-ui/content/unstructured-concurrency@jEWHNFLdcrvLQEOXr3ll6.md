# Unstructured Concurrency

Unstructured concurrency in Swift allows you to create and manage concurrent tasks without adhering to a strict parent-child relationship. This means you can launch asynchronous operations independently, and their lifecycles are not necessarily tied to the scope in which they were created. It provides flexibility in managing concurrency but requires careful handling to avoid issues like resource leaks or unexpected behavior.
