# Swift for Server Apps

Swift isn't just for iOS and macOS apps; it can also be used to build server-side applications. This allows developers to use their existing Swift knowledge to create backends, APIs, and other server-side components, potentially leading to more efficient development workflows and code sharing between client and server. Frameworks like Vapor and Kitura provide the necessary tools and libraries to build robust and scalable server applications using Swift.
