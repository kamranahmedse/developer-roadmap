# Type Inference

Type inference is a feature in Swift that allows the compiler to automatically deduce the data type of a variable or constant based on the value assigned to it. This means you don't always have to explicitly declare the type when creating variables; Swift can figure it out for you, making your code cleaner and more concise.
