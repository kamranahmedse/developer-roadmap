# Basic Functions

Functions are self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task. You define a function with a name, a set of inputs (parameters), and a return type. When you call a function, you execute the code within its block, potentially passing in values for the parameters, and the function may return a value as a result. They help organize code, make it reusable, and improve readability.
