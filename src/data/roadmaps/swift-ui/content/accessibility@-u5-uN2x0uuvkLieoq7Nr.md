# Accessibility

Accessibility focuses on making your app usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. This involves providing alternative ways to interact with your app's content and controls, such as using screen readers, switch controls, or larger fonts. By implementing accessibility features, you ensure that your app is inclusive and provides a positive experience for all users, regardless of their abilities.
