# Optionals and nil

In Swift, an optional is a type that can hold either a value or the absence of a value (represented by `nil`). It's a way to indicate that a variable might not have a value at a particular time. `nil` itself represents the lack of a value for a variable of an optional type. Optionals are used to handle situations where a value might be missing, preventing unexpected errors and crashes in your code.
