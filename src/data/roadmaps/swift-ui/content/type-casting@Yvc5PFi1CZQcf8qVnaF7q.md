# Type Casting

Type casting is a way to check the type of an instance, or to treat that instance as if it were a different superclass or subclass from somewhere else in its own class hierarchy. It's essentially a way to access an object as a different type than it was originally declared to be. Swift provides `is` and `as` operators to perform type checking and casting, allowing you to safely work with different types at runtime.
