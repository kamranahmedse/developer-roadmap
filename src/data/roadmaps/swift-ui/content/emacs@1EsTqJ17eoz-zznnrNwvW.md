# Emacs

Emacs is a highly customizable and extensible text editor, known for its powerful editing capabilities and extensive ecosystem of packages. It's more than just a text editor; it's often described as an operating system within an operating system, allowing users to tailor the environment to their specific needs through Lisp programming. While not as commonly used as Xcode for Swift and SwiftUI development, Emacs can be configured to provide a robust coding environment with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging support.
