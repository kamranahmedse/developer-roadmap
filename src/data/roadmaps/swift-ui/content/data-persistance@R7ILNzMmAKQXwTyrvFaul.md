# Data Persistence

Data persistence refers to the ability of an application to store data in a way that it remains available even after the application is closed or the device is restarted. This allows apps to remember user preferences, save progress, or maintain data across multiple sessions. In Swift and SwiftUI, various techniques can be employed to achieve data persistence, ranging from simple methods like storing data in UserDefaults to more complex solutions like using Core Data or external databases.
