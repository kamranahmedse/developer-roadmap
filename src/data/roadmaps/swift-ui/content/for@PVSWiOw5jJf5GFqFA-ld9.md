# For-in Loops in Swift

In Swift, a `for` loop provides a clean and concise way to iterate over a sequence of items, such as elements in an array, characters in a string, or a range of numbers. It executes a block of code repeatedly for each item in the sequence. The basic structure involves specifying a loop variable that takes on the value of each item in the sequence during each iteration, allowing you to perform operations on each item within the loop's body.
