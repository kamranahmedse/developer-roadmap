Swift is a modern, general-purpose programming language developed by Apple. It's designed to be safe, fast, and expressive, making it a great choice for building applications across Apple's platforms, including iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Swift combines the best aspects of C and Objective-C without the constraints of C compatibility.
