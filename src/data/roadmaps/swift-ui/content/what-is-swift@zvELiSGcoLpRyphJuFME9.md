# What is Swift?

Swift is a powerful, open-source programming language created by **Apple**. It was introduced to the world in **2014** at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).

Before Swift, building apps for iPhones and Macs required a difficult language called Objective-C. Apple built Swift from the ground up to be a modern replacement—it is designed to be **fast, safe, and interactive**.

Think of Swift as a general-purpose language. While it is famous for building apps for Apple devices (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS), it is arguably one of the most versatile languages available today. It is a **compiled language**, meaning the code you write is translated directly into machine code (zeros and ones) that the computer understands, making it incredibly fast.

**Key Characteristics:**
* **Modern:** It drops old, clunky syntax (like semi-colons at the end of every line).
* **Safe:** It prevents common programming errors that usually cause apps to crash.
* **Open Source:** This means anyone can contribute to it, and it can be used on Linux and Windows, not just Apple computers.
