# App Architecture

App architecture is the structural design of an application, defining its components, their relationships, and how they interact to achieve the app's functionality. It provides a blueprint for organizing code, managing data, and handling user interactions, ensuring the app is maintainable, scalable, and testable. A well-defined architecture helps developers understand the codebase, collaborate effectively, and adapt to changing requirements.
