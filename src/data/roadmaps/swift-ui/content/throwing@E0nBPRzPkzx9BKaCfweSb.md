# Throwing Errors in Swift

Throwing errors allows you to signal that something unexpected or problematic has occurred during the execution of your code. When a function encounters a situation it can't handle normally, it can `throw` an error. This error is then passed up the call stack until it's `caught` and handled by an appropriate error handling mechanism, preventing the program from crashing and allowing for graceful recovery or reporting of the issue.
