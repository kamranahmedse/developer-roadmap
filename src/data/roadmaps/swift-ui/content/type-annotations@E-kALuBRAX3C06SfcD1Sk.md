# Type Annotations

Type annotations in Swift are a way to explicitly specify the type of a variable or constant.  Instead of letting Swift infer the type based on the initial value, you tell the compiler exactly what kind of data the variable will hold, such as an `Int`, `String`, or `Bool`. This provides clarity and can help catch errors during compilation.
