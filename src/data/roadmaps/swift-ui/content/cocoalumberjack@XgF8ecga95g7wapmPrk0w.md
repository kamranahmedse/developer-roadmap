# CocoaLumberjack

CocoaLumberjack is a logging framework for Objective-C and Swift that provides a flexible and powerful way to record and manage log messages in your applications. It allows you to log to multiple destinations simultaneously, such as the console, files, or even remote servers, and offers different log levels to filter messages based on their severity. CocoaLumberjack also supports asynchronous logging to avoid blocking the main thread and provides features like log file rotation and archiving.
