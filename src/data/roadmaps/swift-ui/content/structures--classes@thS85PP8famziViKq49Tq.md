# Structures & Classes

Structures and classes are fundamental building blocks in Swift for creating custom data types. They allow you to group related variables (properties) and functions (methods) into a single, reusable unit. Structures are value types, meaning they are copied when passed around, while classes are reference types, meaning they share a single instance in memory. This difference impacts how data is modified and shared within your application.
