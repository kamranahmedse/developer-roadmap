# ViewBuilder

`ViewBuilder` is a result builder attribute in Swift that allows you to build complex views in a declarative and concise way. It essentially transforms a series of statements into a single view, automatically handling the logic of combining multiple views together. This is particularly useful when creating custom views or complex layouts where you need to conditionally display different content based on certain conditions.
