# Drag & Drop

Drag and drop is a user interface interaction that allows users to select an item (the "drag") and move it to a different location (the "drop"). This interaction is commonly used for rearranging items in a list, moving files between folders, or transferring data between different parts of an application. It provides a direct and intuitive way for users to manipulate elements within a graphical user interface.
