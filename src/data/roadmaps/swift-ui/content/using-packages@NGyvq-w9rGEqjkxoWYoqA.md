# Using Packages

Swift Package Manager lets you add external libraries and tools to your Swift projects. Using packages involves declaring dependencies in your `Package.swift` file, which tells Swift Package Manager where to find the code you want to use. Once declared, Swift Package Manager handles downloading, building, and linking the package into your project, making the functionality available for you to use in your code.
