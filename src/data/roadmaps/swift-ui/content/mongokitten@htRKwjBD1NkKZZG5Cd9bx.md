# MongoKitten

MongoKitten is a native Swift driver for MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. It allows Swift applications, including those built with SwiftUI, to interact with MongoDB databases for storing and retrieving data. This interaction involves establishing a connection, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and managing data structures within the MongoDB environment, all directly from Swift code.
