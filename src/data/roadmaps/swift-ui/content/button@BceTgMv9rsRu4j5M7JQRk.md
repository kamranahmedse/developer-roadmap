# Button

A Button is a fundamental UI element that triggers an action when tapped or clicked. It's essentially a tappable area on the screen that, when interacted with, executes a predefined piece of code. Buttons are used to initiate actions like submitting forms, navigating to different screens, or performing specific tasks within an application.
