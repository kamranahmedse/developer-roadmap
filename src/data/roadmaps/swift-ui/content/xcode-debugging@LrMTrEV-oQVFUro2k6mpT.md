# Xcode Debugger

The Xcode debugger is a powerful tool built into the Xcode IDE that allows developers to step through their code line by line, inspect variables, and understand the flow of execution. It helps identify and fix bugs by providing insights into the application's state at various points in time. You can set breakpoints to pause execution, examine the call stack to trace the sequence of function calls, and use the console to print out values or execute custom commands.
