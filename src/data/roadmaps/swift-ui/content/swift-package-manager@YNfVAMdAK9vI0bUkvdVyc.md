# Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing dependencies in your Swift projects. It automates the process of downloading, building, and linking external libraries and frameworks into your code. This allows you to easily reuse code written by others and share your own code with the Swift community, promoting modularity and code reuse.
