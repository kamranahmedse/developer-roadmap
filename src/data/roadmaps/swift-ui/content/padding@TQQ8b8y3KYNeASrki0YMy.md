# Padding

Padding in Swift and SwiftUI is used to add space around the content of a view. It essentially creates a buffer zone between the view's content and its surrounding elements or the edges of its parent view. This helps improve the visual appearance and readability of your user interface by preventing elements from appearing cramped or too close together. You can control the amount of padding applied to all sides of a view or specify different padding values for each side (top, leading, bottom, trailing).
