# @State

`@State` is a property wrapper in SwiftUI that allows you to manage the state of a view. It's used to store values that can change over time and trigger updates to the view when they do. When a property is marked with `@State`, SwiftUI automatically manages the storage and ensures that the view is re-rendered whenever the value changes, reflecting the updated data in the user interface.
