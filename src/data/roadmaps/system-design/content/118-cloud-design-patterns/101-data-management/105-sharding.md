# Sharding

Sharding is a technique used to horizontally partition a large data set across multiple servers, in order to improve the performance, scalability, and availability of a system. This is done by breaking the data set into smaller chunks, called shards, and distributing the shards across multiple servers. Each shard is self-contained and can be managed and scaled independently of the other shards. Sharding can be used in scenarios like scalability, availability, and geo-distribution. Sharding can be implemented using several different algorithms such as range-based sharding, hash-based sharding, and directory-based sharding.
