# Resilience

Resiliency is the ability of a system to gracefully handle and recover from failures, both inadvertent and malicious.

The nature of cloud hosting, where applications are often multi-tenant, use shared platform services, compete for resources and bandwidth, communicate over the Internet, and run on commodity hardware means there is an increased likelihood that both transient and more permanent faults will arise. The connected nature of the internet and the rise in sophistication and volume of attacks increase the likelihood of a security disruption.

Detecting failures and recovering quickly and efficiently, is necessary to maintain resiliency.
