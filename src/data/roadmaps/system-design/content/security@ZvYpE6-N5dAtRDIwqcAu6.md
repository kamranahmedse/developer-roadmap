# Security

Security provides confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances against malicious attacks on information systems (and safety assurances for attacks on operational technology systems). Losing these assurances can negatively impact your business operations and revenue, as well as your organization's reputation in the marketplace. Maintaining security requires following well-established practices (security hygiene) and being vigilant to detect and rapidly remediate vulnerabilities and active attacks.
