# Web Server Caching

[Reverse proxies](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#reverse-proxy-web-server) and caches such as [Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/) can serve static and dynamic content directly. Web servers can also cache requests, returning responses without having to contact application servers.
