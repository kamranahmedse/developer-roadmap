# Sequential Convoy

Sequential Convoy is a pattern that allows for the execution of a series of tasks, or convoy, in a specific order. This pattern can be used to ensure that a set of dependent tasks are executed in the correct order and to handle errors or failures during the execution of the tasks. It can be used in scenarios like workflow and transaction. It can be implemented using a variety of technologies such as state machines, workflows, and transactions.
