# Replication

Replication is an availability pattern that involves having multiple copies of the same data stored in different locations. In the event of a failure, the data can be retrieved from a different location. There are two main types of replication: Master-Master replication and Master-Slave replication.

*   **Master-Master replication:** In this type of replication, multiple servers are configured as "masters," and each one can accept read and write operations. This allows for high availability and allows any of the servers to take over if one of them fails. However, this type of replication can lead to conflicts if multiple servers update the same data at the same time, so some conflict resolution mechanism is needed to handle this.
    
*   **Master-Slave replication:** In this type of replication, one server is designated as the "master" and handles all write operations, while multiple "slave" servers handle read operations. If the master fails, one of the slaves can be promoted to take its place. This type of replication is simpler to set up and maintain compared to Master-Master replication.
