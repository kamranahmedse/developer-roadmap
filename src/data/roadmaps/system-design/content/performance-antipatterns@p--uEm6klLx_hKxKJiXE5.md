# Performance Antipatterns

Performance antipatterns in system design refer to common mistakes or suboptimal practices that can lead to poor performance in a system. These patterns can occur at different levels of the system and can be caused by a variety of factors such as poor design, lack of optimization, or lack of understanding of the workload.

Some of the examples of performance antipatterns include:

*   **N+1 queries:** This occurs when a system makes multiple queries to a database to retrieve related data, instead of using a single query to retrieve all the necessary data.
*   **Chatty interfaces:** This occurs when a system makes too many small and frequent requests to an external service or API, instead of making fewer, larger requests.
*   **Unbounded data:** This occurs when a system retrieves or processes more data than is necessary for the task at hand, leading to increased resource usage and reduced performance.
*   **Inefficient algorithms:** This occurs when a system uses an algorithm that is not well suited to the task at hand, leading to increased resource usage and reduced performance.
