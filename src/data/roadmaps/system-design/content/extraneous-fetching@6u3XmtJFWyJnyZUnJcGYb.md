# Extraneous Fetching

Extraneous fetching in system design refers to the practice of retrieving more data than is needed for a specific task or operation. This can occur when a system is not optimized for the specific workload or when the system is not properly designed to handle the data requirements.

Extraneous fetching can lead to a number of issues, such as:

*   Performance degradation
*   Increased resource utilization
*   Increased network traffic
*   Poor user experience
