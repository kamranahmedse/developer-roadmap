# Back Pressure

If queues start to grow significantly, the queue size can become larger than memory, resulting in cache misses, disk reads, and even slower performance. [Back pressure](http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2012/05/apply-back-pressure-when-overloaded.html) can help by limiting the queue size, thereby maintaining a high throughput rate and good response times for jobs already in the queue. Once the queue fills up, clients get a server busy or HTTP 503 status code to try again later. Clients can retry the request at a later time, perhaps with [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff).
