# Availability in Numbers

Availability is often quantified by uptime (or downtime) as a percentage of time the service is available. Availability is generally measured in number of 9s--a service with 99.99% availability is described as having four 9s.

99.9% Availability - Three 9s:
------------------------------

    Duration           | Acceptable downtime
    -------------      | -------------
    Downtime per year  | 8h 41min 38s
    Downtime per month | 43m 28s
    Downtime per week  | 10m 4.8s
    Downtime per day   | 1m 26s
    

99.99% Availability - Four 9s
-----------------------------

    Duration           | Acceptable downtime
    -------------      | -------------
    Downtime per year  | 52min 9.8s
    Downtime per month | 4m 21s
    Downtime per week  | 1m 0.5s
    Downtime per day   | 8.6s
    

Availability in parallel vs in sequence
---------------------------------------

If a service consists of multiple components prone to failure, the service's overall availability depends on whether the components are in sequence or in parallel.

### In sequence

Overall availability decreases when two components with availability < 100% are in sequence:

    Availability (Total) = Availability (Foo) * Availability (Bar)
    

If both `Foo` and `Bar` each had 99.9% availability, their total availability in sequence would be 99.8%.

### In parallel

Overall availability increases when two components with availability < 100% are in parallel:

    Availability (Total) = 1 - (1 - Availability (Foo)) * (1 - Availability (Bar))
    

If both `Foo` and `Bar` each had 99.9% availability, their total availability in parallel would be 99.9999%.
