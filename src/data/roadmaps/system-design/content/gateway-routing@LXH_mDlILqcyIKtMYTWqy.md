# Gateway Routing

Route requests to multiple services or multiple service instances using a single endpoint. The pattern is useful when you want to:

*   Expose multiple services on a single endpoint and route to the appropriate service based on the request
*   Expose multiple instances of the same service on a single endpoint for load balancing or availability purposes
*   Expose differing versions of the same service on a single endpoint and route traffic across the different versions
