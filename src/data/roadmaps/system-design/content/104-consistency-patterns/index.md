# Consistency Patterns

Consistency patterns refer to the ways in which data is stored and managed in a distributed system, and how that data is made available to users and applications. There are three main types of consistency patterns:

- Strong consistency
- Weak consistency
- Eventual Consistency

Each of these patterns has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which pattern to use will depend on the specific requirements of the application or system.
