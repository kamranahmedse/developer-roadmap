# SQL Tuning

SQL tuning is the attempt to diagnose and repair SQL statements that fail to meet a performance standard. It is a broad topic and many books have been written as reference. It's important to benchmark and profile to simulate and uncover bottlenecks.

- Benchmark - Simulate high-load situations with tools such as ab.
- Profile - Enable tools such as the slow query log to help track performance issues.

Benchmarking and profiling might point you to the following optimizations.
