# Noisy Neighbor

Noisy neighbor refers to a situation in which one or more components of a system are utilizing a disproportionate amount of shared resources, leading to resource contention and reduced performance for other components. This can occur when a system is not properly designed or configured to handle the workload, or when a component is behaving unexpectedly.

Examples of noisy neighbor scenarios include:

- One user on a shared server utilizing a large amount of CPU or memory, leading to reduced performance for other users on the same server.
- One process on a shared server utilizing a large amount of I/O, causing other processes to experience slow I/O and increased latency.
- One application consuming a large amount of network bandwidth, causing other applications to experience reduced throughput.
