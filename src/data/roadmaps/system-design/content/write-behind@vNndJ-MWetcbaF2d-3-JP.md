# Write-behind

In write-behind, the application does the following:

*   Add/update entry in cache
*   Asynchronously write entry to the data store, improving write performance

Disadvantages of write-behind:
------------------------------

*   There could be data loss if the cache goes down prior to its contents hitting the data store.
*   It is more complex to implement write-behind than it is to implement cache-aside or write-through.
