# Returning Results

Background jobs execute asynchronously in a separate process, or even in a separate location, from the UI or the process that invoked the background task. Ideally, background tasks are "fire and forget" operations, and their execution progress has no impact on the UI or the calling process. This means that the calling process does not wait for completion of the tasks. Therefore, it cannot automatically detect when the task ends.
