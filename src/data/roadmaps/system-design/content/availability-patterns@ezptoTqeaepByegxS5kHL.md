# Availability Patterns

Availability patterns are established architectural approaches used to ensure a system remains operational and accessible to users, even in the face of failures or unexpected events. These patterns focus on minimizing downtime and maintaining a consistent level of service by incorporating redundancy, fault tolerance, and recovery mechanisms into the system's design. They provide a structured way to address potential points of failure and ensure business continuity.
