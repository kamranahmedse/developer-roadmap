# Caching

Caching is the process of storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage location, called a cache, in order to quickly retrieve it without the need to query the original data source. This can improve the performance of an application by reducing the number of times a data source must be accessed.

There are several caching strategies:

*   Refresh Ahead
*   Write-Behind
*   Write-through
*   Cache Aside

Also, you can have the cache in several places, examples include:

*   Client Caching
*   CDN Caching
*   Web Server Caching
*   Database Caching
*   Application Caching
