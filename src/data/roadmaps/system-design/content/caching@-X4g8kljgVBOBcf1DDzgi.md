# Caching

Caching is the process of storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage location, called a cache, in order to quickly retrieve it without the need to query the original data source. This can improve the performance of an application by reducing the number of times a data source must be accessed.

There are several caching strategies:

- Refresh Ahead
- Write-Behind
- Write-through
- Cache Aside

Also, you can have the cache in several places, examples include:

- Client Caching
- CDN Caching
- Web Server Caching
- Database Caching
- Application Caching
