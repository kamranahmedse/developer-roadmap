# High availability

Azure infrastructure is composed of geographies, regions, and Availability Zones, which limit the blast radius of a failure and therefore limit potential impact to customer applications and data. The Azure Availability Zones construct was developed to provide a software and networking solution to protect against datacenter failures and to provide increased high availability (HA) to our customers. With HA architecture there is a balance between high resilience, low latency, and cost.
