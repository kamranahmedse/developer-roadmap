# Domain Name System

A Domain Name System (DNS) translates a domain name such as [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) to an IP address.

DNS is hierarchical, with a few authoritative servers at the top level. Your router or ISP provides information about which DNS server(s) to contact when doing a lookup. Lower level DNS servers cache mappings, which could become stale due to DNS propagation delays. DNS results can also be cached by your browser or OS for a certain period of time, determined by the time to live (TTL).

*   NS record (name server) - Specifies the DNS servers for your domain/subdomain.
*   MX record (mail exchange) - Specifies the mail servers for accepting messages.
*   A record (address) - Points a name to an IP address.
*   CNAME (canonical) - Points a name to another name or CNAME ([example.com](http://example.com) to [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)) or to an A record.

Services such as [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/) and [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) provide managed DNS services. Some DNS services can route traffic through various methods:

    *   Prevent traffic from going to servers under maintenance
    *   Balance between varying cluster sizes
    *   A/B testing
