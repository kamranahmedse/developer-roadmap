# Busy Frontend

A busy frontend happens when the user-facing part of the system — such as the web servers, CDN, or browser — is handling more work than it can efficiently manage. This can lead to slow page loads, delayed responses, or timeouts. Common causes include too many concurrent users, large static assets, heavy client-side rendering, or missing caching layers.

To improve responsiveness, you can use CDNs to cache static files, optimize and lazy-load scripts, balance requests across multiple servers, and reduce unnecessary API calls. The goal is to make sure the frontend remains fast and responsive even under heavy traffic.
