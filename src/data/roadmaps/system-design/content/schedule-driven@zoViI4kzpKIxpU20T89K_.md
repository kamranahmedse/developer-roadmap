# Schedule Driven

Schedule-driven invocation uses a timer to start the background task. Examples of using schedule-driven triggers include:

- A timer that is running locally within the application or as part of the application's operating system invokes a background task on a regular basis.
- A timer that is running in a different application, such as Azure Logic Apps, sends a request to an API or web service on a regular basis. The API or web service invokes the background task.
- A separate process or application starts a timer that causes the background task to be invoked once after a specified time delay, or at a specific time.

Typical examples of tasks that are suited to schedule-driven invocation include batch-processing routines (such as updating related-products lists for users based on their recent behavior), routine data processing tasks (such as updating indexes or generating accumulated results), data analysis for daily reports, data retention cleanup, and data consistency checks.
