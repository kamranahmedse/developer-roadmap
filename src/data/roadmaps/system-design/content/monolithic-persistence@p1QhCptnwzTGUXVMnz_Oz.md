# Monolithic Persistence

Monolithic Persistence refers to the use of a single, monolithic database to store all of the data for an application or system. This approach can be used for simple, small-scale systems but as the system grows and evolves it can become a bottleneck, resulting in poor scalability, limited flexibility, and increased complexity. To address these limitations, a number of approaches can be taken such as Microservices, Sharding, and NoSQL databases.
