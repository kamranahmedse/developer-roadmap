# Cache-aside

The application is responsible for reading and writing from storage. The cache does not interact with storage directly. The application does the following:

*   Look for entry in cache, resulting in a cache miss
*   Load entry from the database
*   Add entry to cache
*   Return entry

    def get_user(self, user_id):
      user = cache.get("user.{0}", user_id)
      if user is None:
        user = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = {0}", user_id)
          if user is not None:
            key = "user.{0}".format(user_id)
            cache.set(key, json.dumps(user))
      return user
    

[Memcached](https://memcached.org/) is generally used in this manner. Subsequent reads of data added to cache are fast. Cache-aside is also referred to as lazy loading. Only requested data is cached, which avoids filling up the cache with data that isn't requested.
