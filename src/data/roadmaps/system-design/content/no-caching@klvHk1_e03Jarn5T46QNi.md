# No Caching

No caching antipattern occurs when a cloud application that handles many concurrent requests, repeatedly fetches the same data. This can reduce performance and scalability.

When data is not cached, it can cause a number of undesirable behaviors, including:

*   Repeatedly fetching the same information from a resource that is expensive to access, in terms of I/O overhead or latency.
*   Repeatedly constructing the same objects or data structures for multiple requests.
*   Making excessive calls to a remote service that has a service quota and throttles clients past a certain limit.
