# Data Engineering vs Data Science

Data engineering and data science are distinct but complementary roles within the field of data. Data engineering focuses on building and maintaining the infrastructure for data collection, storage, and processing, essentially creating the systems that make data available for downstream users. On the other hand, data science professionals, like data analysts and data scientists, uses that data to extract insights, build predictive models, and ultimately inform decision-making.
