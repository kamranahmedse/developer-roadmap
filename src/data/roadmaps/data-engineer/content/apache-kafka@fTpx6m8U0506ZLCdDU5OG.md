# Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation. It is written in Scala and Java and operates based on a message queue, designed to handle real-time data feeds. Kafka functions as a kind of message broker service in between the data producers and the consumers, facilitating efficient transmission of data. It can be viewed as a durable message broker where applications can process and reprocess streamed data. Kafka is a highly scalable and fault-tolerant system which ensures data delivery without loss.
