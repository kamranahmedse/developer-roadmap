# CouchDB

Apache CouchDB is an open source NoSQL document database that collects and stores data in JSON-based document formats. Unlike relational databases, CouchDB uses a schema-free data model, which simplifies record management across various computing devices, mobile phones and web browsers. In CouchDB, each document is uniquely named in the database, and CouchDB provides a RESTful HTTP API for reading and updating (add, edit, delete) database documents. Documents are the primary unit of data in CouchDB and consist of any number of fields and attachments.
