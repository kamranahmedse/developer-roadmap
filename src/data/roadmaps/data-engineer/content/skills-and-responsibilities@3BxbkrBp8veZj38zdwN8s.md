# Skills and Responsibilities

Here’s a list of essential data engineering skills:

1. SQL & Database Management: Ability to query, manipulate, and design relational databases efficiently using SQL. This is the bread-and-butter for extracting, transforming, and analyzing data.

2. Data Modeling: Designing schemas and structures (star, snowflake, normalized forms) to optimize storage, performance, and usability of data.

3. ETL/ELT Development: Building Extract-Transform-Load (or Load-Transform) pipelines to move and reshape data between systems while ensuring quality and consistency.

4. Big Data Frameworks: Proficiency with tools like Apache Spark, Hadoop, or Flink to process and analyze massive datasets in distributed environments.

5. Cloud Platforms: Working knowledge of AWS, Azure, or GCP for storage, compute, and orchestration (e.g., S3, BigQuery, Dataflow, Redshift).

6. Data Warehousing: Understanding concepts and tools (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) for centralizing, optimizing, and querying large volumes of business data.

7. Workflow Orchestration: Using tools like Apache Airflow, Prefect, or Dagster to automate and schedule complex data pipelines reliably.

8. Scripting & Programming: Strong skills in Python or Scala for building data processing scripts, automation tasks, and integration with APIs.

9. Data Governance & Security: Applying practices for data quality, lineage tracking, access control, compliance (GDPR, HIPAA), and encryption.

10. Monitoring & Performance Optimization: Setting up alerts, logging, and tuning pipelines to ensure they run efficiently, catch errors early, and scale smoothly.
