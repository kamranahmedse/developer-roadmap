# Logs

Logs are files that record events, activities, and system operations over time. They provide a detailed historical record of what has happened within a system, including timestamps, event details, performance data, errors, and user actions. Logs are crucial for troubleshooting problems, monitoring system health and performance, investigating security incidents, and understanding how users interact with a system.
