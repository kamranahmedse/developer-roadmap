# Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization technology. It enables developers to package applications with all their dependencies into standardized units called containers, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments. Docker provides a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization, using OS-level virtualization to run multiple isolated systems on a single host. Its ecosystem includes tools for building, sharing, and running containers, such as Docker Engine, Docker Hub, and Docker Compose. Docker has become integral to modern DevOps practices, facilitating microservices architectures, continuous integration/deployment pipelines, and efficient resource utilization in both development and production environments.
