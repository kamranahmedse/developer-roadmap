# Apache Hadoop YARN

Apache Hadoop YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is the part of Hadoop that manages resources and runs jobs on a cluster. It has a ResourceManager that controls all cluster resources and an ApplicationMaster for each job that schedules and runs tasks. YARN lets different tools like MapReduce and Spark share the same cluster, making it more efficient, flexible, and reliable.
