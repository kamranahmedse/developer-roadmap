Apache Spark is an open-source distributed computing system designed for big data processing and analytics. It offers a unified interface for programming entire clusters, enabling efficient handling of large-scale data with built-in support for data parallelism and fault tolerance. Spark excels in processing tasks like batch processing, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and graph processing. Itâ€™s known for its speed, ease of use, and ability to process data in-memory, significantly outperforming traditional MapReduce systems. Spark is widely used in big data ecosystems for its scalability and versatility across various data processing tasks.
