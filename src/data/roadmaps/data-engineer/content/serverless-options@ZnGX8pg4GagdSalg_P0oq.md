# Serverless Options

Serverless data storage involves using cloud provider services for databases and object storage that automatically scale infrastructure and implement a consumption-based, pay-as-you-go model, eliminating the need for developers to manage, provision, or maintain any physical or virtual servers. This approach simplifies development, reduces operational overhead, and offers cost-effectiveness by charging only for the resources used, allowing teams to focus on applications rather than infrastructure management.
