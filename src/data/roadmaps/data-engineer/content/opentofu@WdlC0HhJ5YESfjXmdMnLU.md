# OpenTofu

OpenTofu is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. OpenTofu can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.
