# Business Intelligence

Business intelligence encompasses a set of techniques and technologies to transform raw data into meaningful insights that drive strategic decision-making within an organization. BI tools enable business users to access different types of data, historical and current, third-party and in-house, as well as semistructured data and unstructured data such as social media. Users can analyze this information to gain insights into how the business is performing and what it should do next.

BI platforms traditionally rely on data warehouses for their baseline information. The strength of a data warehouse is that it aggregates data from multiple data sources into one central system to support business data analytics and reporting. BI presents the results to the user in the form of reports, charts and maps, which might be displayed through a dashboard.
