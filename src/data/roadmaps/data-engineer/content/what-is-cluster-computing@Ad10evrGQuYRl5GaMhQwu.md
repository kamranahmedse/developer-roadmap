# What is Cluster Computing

Cluster computing is a type of distributing computing where multiple computers are connected so they work together as a single system. By working together, a cluster of machines can address complex tasks with higher computational power and efficiency.

The term “cluster” refers to the network of linked computer systems programmed to perform the same task. Computing clusters typically consist of servers, workstations and personal computers (PCs) that communicate over a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN). Each computer or “node,” in a computer network has an operating system (OS) and a central processing unit (CPU) core that handles the tasks required for the software to run properly.
