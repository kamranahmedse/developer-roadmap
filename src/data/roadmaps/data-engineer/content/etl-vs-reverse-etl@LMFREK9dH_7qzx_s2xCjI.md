# ETL vs Reverse ETL

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a key process in data warehousing, enabling the integration of data from multiple sources into a centralized database. 

Reverse ETL emerged as organizations recognized that their carefully curated data warehouses, while excellent for analysis, created a new form of data silo that prevented operational teams from accessing valuable insights. This methodology addresses the critical gap between analytical insights and operational execution by systematically moving processed data from centralized repositories back to the operational systems where business teams interact with customers and manage daily operations.
