# Aurora DB

Amazon Aurora (Aurora) is a fully managed relational database engine that's compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. Aurora includes a high-performance storage subsystem. Its MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible database engines are customized to take advantage of that fast distributed storage. The underlying storage grows automatically as needed. Aurora also automates and standardizes database clustering and replication, which are typically among the most challenging aspects of database configuration and administration.
