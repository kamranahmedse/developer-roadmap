# Authentication vs Authorization

Authentication and authorization are popular terms in modern computer systems that often confuse people. **Authentication** is the process of confirming the identity of a user or a device (i.e., an entity). During the authentication process, an entity usually relies on some proof to authenticate itself, i.e. an authentication factor. In contrast to authentication, **authorization** refers to the process of verifying what resources entities (users or devices) can access, or what actions they can perform, i.e., their access rights.
