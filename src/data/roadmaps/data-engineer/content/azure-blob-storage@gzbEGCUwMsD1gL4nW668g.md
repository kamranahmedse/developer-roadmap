# Azure Blob Storage

Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. “Blob” stands for Binary Large Object, a term used to describe storage for unstructured data like text, images, and video. Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft Azure’s solution for storing these blobs in the cloud. It offers flexible storage—you only pay based on your usage. Depending on the access speed you need for your data, you can choose from various storage tiers (hot, cool, and archive). Being cloud-based, it is scalable, secure, and easy to manage.
