# End-to-End Testing

End-to-end or (E2E) testing is a form of testing used to assert your entire application works as expected from start to finish or "end-to-end". E2E testing differs from unit testing in that it is completely decoupled from the underlying implementation details of your code. It is typically used to validate an application in a way that mimics the way a user would interact with it.
