# Choosing the Right Technologies

The data engineering ecosystem is rapidly expanding, and selecting the right technologies for your use case can be challenging. Below you can find some considerations for choosing data technologies across the data engineering lifecycle:

*   **Team size and capabilities.** Your team's size will determine the amount of bandwidth your team can dedicate to complex solutions. For small teams, try to stick to simple solutions and technologies your team is familiar with.
*   **Interoperability**. When choosing a technology or system, youâ€™ll need to ensure that it interacts and operates smoothly with other technologies.
*   **Cost optimization and business value,** Consider direct and indirect costs of a technology and the opportunity cost of choosing some technologies over others.
*   **Location** Companies have many options when it comes to choosing where to run their technology stack, including cloud providers, on-premises systems, hybrid clouds, and multicloud.
*   **Build versus buy**. Depending on your needs and capabilities, you can either invest in building your own technologies, implement open-source solutions, or purchase proprietary solutions and services.
*   **Server versus serverless**. Depending on your needs, you may prefer server-based setups, where developers manage servers, or serverless systems, which translates the server management to cloud providers, allowing developers to focus solely on writing code.
