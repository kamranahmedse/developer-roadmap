# MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL, open-source database designed for storing and managing large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. It uses a document-oriented data model where data is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which allows for flexible and hierarchical data representation. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB doesn't require a fixed schema, making it suitable for applications with evolving data requirements or varying data structures. It supports horizontal scaling through sharding and offers high availability with replica sets. MongoDB is commonly used for applications requiring rapid development, real-time analytics, and large-scale data handling, such as content management systems, IoT applications, and big data platforms.
