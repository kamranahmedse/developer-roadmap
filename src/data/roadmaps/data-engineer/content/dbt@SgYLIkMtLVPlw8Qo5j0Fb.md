# dbt

dbt, also known as the data build tool, is designed to simplify the management of data warehouses and transform the data within. This is primarily the T, or transformation, within ELT (or sometimes ETL) processes. It allows for easy transition between data warehouse types, such as Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, or DuckDB. dbt also provides the ability to use SQL across teams of multiple users, simplifying interaction. In addition, dbt translates between SQL dialects as appropriate to connect to different data sources and warehouses.
