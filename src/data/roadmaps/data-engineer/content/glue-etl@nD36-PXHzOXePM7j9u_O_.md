AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service from Amazon Web Services. It helps you discover, prepare, and combine data from different sources for analytics, machine learning, and application development. With Glue, you can build and run extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines without managing any infrastructure. It supports automatic schema discovery, job scheduling, and integrates with services like Amazon S3, Redshift, and RDS. You pay only for the resources used while your jobs run, making it a flexible and cost-efficient solution.
