# HBase

HBase is a column-oriented No-SQL database management system that runs on top of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), a main component of Apache Hadoop. HBase provides a fault-tolerant way of storing sparse data sets, which are common in many big data use cases. It is well suited for real-time data processing or random read/write access to large volumes of data. HBase applications are written in Javaâ„¢ much like a typical Apache MapReduce application.
