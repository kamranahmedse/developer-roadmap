# Azure Virtual Machines

Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) enable virtualization without requiring hardware investments. They provide customizable environments for development, testing, and cloud applications so you can run different operating systems like Ubuntu on a Windows host based on your needs. One of the key advantages of Azure VMs is the pay-as-you-go pricing model. It allows you to scale resources up or down as needed, ensuring cost efficiency without wasting resources.
