# Prefect

Prefect is an open-source orchestration engine that turns your Python functions into production-grade data pipelines with minimal friction. You can build and schedule workflows in pure Python—no DSLs or complex config files—and run them anywhere you can run Python. Prefect handles the heavy lifting for you out of the box: automatic state tracking, failure handling, real-time monitoring, and more.
