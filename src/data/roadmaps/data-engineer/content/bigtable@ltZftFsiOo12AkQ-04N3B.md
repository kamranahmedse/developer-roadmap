# BigTable

Bigtable is a high-performance, scalable database that excels at capturing, processing, and analyzing data in real-time. It aggregates data as it's written, providing immediate insights into user behavior, A/B testing results, and engagement metrics. This real-time capability also fuels AI/ML models for interactive applications. Bigtable integrates seamlessly with both Dataflow, enriching streaming pipelines with low-latency lookups, and BigQuery, enabling real-time serving of analytics in user facing application and ad-hoc querying on the same data.
