# Google Cloud Storage

Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is a scalable, secure, and durable object storage service within Google Cloud Platform (GCP) designed for storing and retrieving unstructured data of any type or size. It allows users to store data in "buckets" and access it through APIs, web interfaces, or command-line tools for applications, backups, media hosting, and big data analytics. GCS offers different storage classes to optimize costs based on data access frequency, strong security with encryption, and high availability through redundant data storage across multiple locations.
