# Column

A columnar database is a type of No-SQL database that stores data by columns instead of by rows. In a traditional SQL database, all the information for one record is stored together, but in a columnar database, all the values for a single column are stored together. This makes it much faster to read and analyze large amounts of data, especially when you only need a few columns instead of the whole record. For example, if you want to quickly find the average sales price from millions of rows, a columnar database can scan just the "price" column instead of every piece of data. This design is often used in data warehouses and analytics systems because it speeds up queries and saves storage space through better compression.
