# Batch

Batch processing is a method in which large volumes of collected data are processed in chunks or batches. This approach is especially effective for resource-intensive jobs, repetitive tasks, and managing extensive datasets where real-time processing isn’t required. It is ideal for applications like data warehousing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), and large-scale reporting. Data batch processing is mainly automated, requiring minimal human interaction once the process is set up. Tasks are predefined, and the system executes them according to a scheduled timeline, typically during off-peak hours when computing resources are readily available.
