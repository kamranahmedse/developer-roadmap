# Sources of Data

Sources of data are origins or locations from which data is collected, categorized as primary (direct, firsthand information) or secondary (collected by others). Common primary sources include surveys, interviews, experiments, and sensor data. Secondary sources encompass databases, published reports, government data, books, articles, and web data like social media posts. Data sources can also be classified as internal (within an organization) or external (from outside sources).
