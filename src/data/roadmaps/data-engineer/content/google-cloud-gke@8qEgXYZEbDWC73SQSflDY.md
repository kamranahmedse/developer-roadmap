## GKE - Google Kubernetes Engine

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by Google Cloud Platform. It allows organizations to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes orchestration. GKE automates cluster management tasks, including upgrades, scaling, and security patches, while providing integration with Google Cloud services. It offers features like auto-scaling, load balancing, and private clusters, enabling developers to focus on application development rather than infrastructure management.
