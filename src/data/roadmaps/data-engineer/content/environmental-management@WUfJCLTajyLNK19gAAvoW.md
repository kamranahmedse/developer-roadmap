# Environmental Management

Environmental management, or Environment as Code (EaC) takes the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  one step further. EaC applies DevOps principles to manage and automate entire software environments—including infrastructure, applications, and configurations—using code, making them reproducible, versionable, and reliable. It extends IaC by focusing not just on the underlying servers and networks but on the complete, connected system of services and applications that run on top of it. This approach helps increase efficiency, speeds up deployments, and provides a consistent, auditable process for creating and managing development, testing, and production environments.
