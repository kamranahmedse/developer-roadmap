# Cluster Management Tools

Cluster management software maximizes the work that a cluster of computers can perform. A cluster manager balances workload to reduce bottlenecks, monitors the health of the elements of the cluster, and manages failover when an element fails. A cluster manager can also help a system administrator to perform administration tasks on elements in the cluster. 

Some of the most popular Cluster Management Tools are Kubernetes and Apache Hadoop YARN.
