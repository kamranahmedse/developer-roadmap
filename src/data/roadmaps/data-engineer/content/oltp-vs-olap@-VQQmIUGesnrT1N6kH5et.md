# OLTP vs OLAP

Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) refers to a class of systems designed to manage transaction-oriented applications, typically for data entry and retrieval transactions in database systems. OLTP systems are characterized by a large number of short online transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), where the emphasis is on speed, efficiency, and maintaining data integrity in multi-access environments. PostgreSQL supports OLTP workloads through features like ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) for high concurrency, efficient indexing, and robust transaction management. These features ensure reliable, fast, and consistent processing of high-volume, high-frequency transactions critical to OLTP applications.

Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) refers to a class of systems designed for query-intensive tasks, typically used for data analysis and business intelligence. OLAP systems handle complex queries that aggregate large volumes of data, often from multiple sources, to support decision-making processes.
