# Data Obfuscation

Statistical data obfuscation involves altering the values of sensitive data in a way that preserves the statistical properties and relationships within the data. It ensures that the masked data maintains the overall distribution, patterns, and correlations of the original data for accurate statistical analysis. Statistical data obfuscation techniques include applying mathematical functions or perturbation algorithms to the data.
