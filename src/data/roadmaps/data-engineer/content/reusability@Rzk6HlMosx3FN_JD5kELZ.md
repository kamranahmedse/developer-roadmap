# Reusability

One of the goals of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is to creat modular, standardized units of code—like modules or  templates that can be used across multiple projects, environments, and teams, embodying the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle. This approach significantly boosts efficiency, consistency, and maintainability, as it allows for rapid deployment of identical infrastructure patterns, enforces organizational standards, simplifies complex setups, and improves collaboration by providing shared, tested building blocks for infrastructure management.
