# Data Factory (ETL)

Data Factory, most commonly referring to Microsoft's Azure Data Factory, is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create, schedule, and orchestrate workflows to move and transform data from various sources into a centralized location for analysis. It provides tools for building Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipelines, enabling businesses to prepare data for analytics, business intelligence, and other data-driven initiatives without extensive coding, thanks to its visual, code-free interface and native connectors.
