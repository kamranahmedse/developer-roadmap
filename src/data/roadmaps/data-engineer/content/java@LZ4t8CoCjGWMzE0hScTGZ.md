Java has had a big influence on data engineering because many core big data tools and frameworks, like Hadoop, Spark (originally in Scala, which runs on the JVM), and Kafka, are built using Java or run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means Javaâ€™s performance, scalability, and cross-platform capabilities have shaped how large-scale data processing systems are designed.
