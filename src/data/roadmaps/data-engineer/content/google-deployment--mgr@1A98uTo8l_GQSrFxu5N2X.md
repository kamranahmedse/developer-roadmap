# Google Deployment  Mgr.

Google Cloud Deployment Manager is an infrastructure deployment service that automates the creation and management of Google Cloud resources. It provides users with flexible template and configuration files to create deployments that have a variety of Google Cloud services, such as Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, and Cloud SQL, configured to work together.

Important, Google Deployment Manager will reach end of support on 31 December 2025. An alternative to this tool is **Google Infrastructure Manager**. Infrastructure Manager (Infra Manager) automates the deployment and management of Google Cloud infrastructure resources using Terraform. Infra Manager allows users to deploy programmatically to Google Cloud, allowing to use this service rather than maintaining a different toolchain to work with Terraform on Google Cloud.
