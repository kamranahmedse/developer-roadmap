# Amazon Redshift

Amazon Redshift is a cloud-based data warehouse service from Amazon that lets you store and analyze large amounts of data quickly. It’s designed for running complex queries on huge datasets, so businesses can use it to turn raw data into useful reports and insights. You can load data into Redshift from many sources, and then use SQL to explore it, just like you would with a regular database — but it’s optimized to handle much bigger data and run faster.
