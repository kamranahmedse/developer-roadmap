# Redis

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store known for its speed and versatility. It supports various data types, including strings, lists, sets, hashes, and sorted sets, and provides functionalities such as caching, session management, real-time analytics, and message brokering. Redis operates as a key-value store, allowing for rapid read and write operations, and is often used to enhance performance and scalability in applications. It supports persistence options to save data to disk, replication for high availability, and clustering for horizontal scaling. Redis is widely used for scenarios requiring low-latency access to data and high-throughput performance.
