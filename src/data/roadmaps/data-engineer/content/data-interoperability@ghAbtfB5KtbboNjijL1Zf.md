# Data Interoperability

Data interoperability is the ability of diverse systems and applications to access, exchange, and cooperatively use data in a coordinated and meaningful way, even across organizational boundaries. It ensures that data can flow freely, maintaining its integrity and context, allowing for improved efficiency, collaboration, and decision-making by breaking down data silos. Achieving data interoperability often relies on data standards, metadata, and common data elements to define how data is collected, formatted, and interpreted.
