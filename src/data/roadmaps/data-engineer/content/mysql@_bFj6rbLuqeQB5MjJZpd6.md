# MySQL

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use. It uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for database interactions and supports a range of features for data management, including transactions, indexing, and stored procedures. MySQL is widely used for web applications, data warehousing, and various other applications due to its scalability and flexibility. It integrates well with many programming languages and platforms, and is often employed in conjunction with web servers and frameworks in popular software stacks like LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl). MySQL is maintained by Oracle Corporation and has a large community and ecosystem supporting its development and use.
