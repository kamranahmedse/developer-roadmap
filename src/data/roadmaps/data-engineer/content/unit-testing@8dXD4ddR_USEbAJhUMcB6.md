# Unit Testing

Unit testing is where individual **units** (modules, functions/methods, routines, etc.) of software are tested to ensure their correctness. This low-level testing ensures smaller components are functionally sound while taking the burden off of higher-level tests. Generally, a developer writes these tests during the development process and they are run as automated tests.
