# Best Practices

1.  **Ensure Reliability.** A robust messaging system must guarantee that messages arenâ€™t lost, even during node failures or network issues. This means using acknowledgments, replication across multiple brokers, and durable storage on disk. These measures ensure that producers and consumers can recover seamlessly without data loss when something goes wrong.
    
2.  **Design for Scalability.** Scalability should be baked in from the start. Partition topics strategically to distribute load across brokers and consumer groups, enabling horizontal scaling.
    
3.  **Maintain Message Ordering.** For systems that depend on message sequence, ensure ordering within partitions and design producers to consistently route related messages to the same partition.
    
4.  **Secure Communication.** Messaging queues often carry sensitive data, so encrypt messages both in transit and at rest. Implement authentication techniques to ensure only trusted clients can publish or consume, and enforce authorization rules to limit access to specific topics or operations.
    
5.  **Monitor & Alert.** Continuous visibility into your messaging system is essential. Track metrics such as message lag, throughput, consumer group health, and broker disk usage. Set alerts for abnormal patterns, like growing lag or dropped connections, so you can respond before they affect downstream systems.
