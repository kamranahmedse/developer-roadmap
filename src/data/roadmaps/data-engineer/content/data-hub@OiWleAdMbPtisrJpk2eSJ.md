# Data Hub

A **data hub** is an architecture that provides a central point for the flow of data between multiple sources and applications, enabling organizations to collect, integrate, and manage data efficiently. Unlike traditional data storage solutions, a data hubâ€™s purpose focuses on data integration and accessibility. The design supports real-time data exchange, which makes accessing, analyzing, and acting on the data faster and easier.

A data hub differs from a data warehouse in that it is generally unintegrated and often at different grains. It differs from an operational data store because a data hub does not need to be limited to operational data. A data hub differs from a data lake by homogenizing data and possibly serving data in multiple desired formats, rather than simply storing it in one place, and by adding other value to the data such as de-duplication, quality, security, and a standardized set of query services.
