# NEO4J

Neo4j is a highly popular open-source graph database designed to store, manage, and query data as interconnected nodes and relationships. Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and rows, Neo4j uses a graph model where data is represented as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), allowing for highly efficient querying of complex, interconnected data. It supports Cypher, a declarative query language specifically designed for graph querying, which simplifies operations like traversing relationships and pattern matching. Neo4j is well-suited for applications involving complex relationships, such as social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection, where understanding and leveraging connections between data points is crucial.
