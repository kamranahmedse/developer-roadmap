# Data Masking

Data masking is a process that creates a copy of real data but replaces sensitive information with false but realistic-looking data, preserving the format and structure of the original data for non-production uses like software testing, training, and development. The goal is to protect confidential information and ensure compliance with data protection regulations by preventing unauthorized access to real sensitive data without compromising the usability of the data for other business functions.
