# Transactions

Transactions in SQL are units of work that group one or more database operations into a single, atomic unit. They ensure data integrity by following the ACID properties: Atomicity (all or nothing), Consistency (database remains in a valid state), Isolation (transactions don't interfere with each other), and Durability (committed changes are permanent). Transactions are essential for maintaining data consistency in complex operations and handling concurrent access to the database.
