# Relational Databases

Relational databases are a type of database management system (DBMS) that organizes data into structured tables with rows and columns, using a schema to define data relationships and constraints. They employ Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and managing data, supporting operations such as data retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion. Relational databases enforce data integrity through keys (primary and foreign) and constraints (such as unique and not-null), and they are designed to handle complex queries, transactions, and data relationships efficiently. Examples of relational databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle Database. They are commonly used for applications requiring structured data storage, strong consistency, and complex querying capabilities.
