# Scala

Scala is a programming language that combines the strengths of object-oriented and functional programming, and it runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In data engineering, Scala is especially important because Apache Spark, one of the most popular big data processing frameworks, was written in Scala. This means Scala can use Sparkâ€™s features directly and efficiently, often with cleaner and more concise code than Java. Its ability to handle complex data transformations with less code makes it a powerful tool for building fast, scalable data pipelines.
