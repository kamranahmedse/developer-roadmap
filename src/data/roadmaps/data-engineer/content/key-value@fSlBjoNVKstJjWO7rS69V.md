# Key-Value

Key value databases, also known as key value stores, are NoSQL database types where data is stored as key value pairs and optimized for reading and writing that data. The data is fetched by a unique key or a number of unique keys to retrieve the associated value with each key. Both keys and values can be anything, ranging from simple objects to complex compound objects. Key-value databases are highly partitionable and allow horizontal scaling at a level that other types of databases cannot achieve.
