# Data Generation

Data generation refers to the different ways data is produced and generated. Thanks to progress in computing power and storage, as well as technology breakthrough in sensor technology (for example, IoT devices), the number of these so-called source systems is rapidly growing. Data is created in many ways, both analog and digital.

**Analog data** refers to continuous, real-world information that is represented by a range of values. It can take on any value within a given range and is often used to describe physical quantities like temperature or sounds.

By contrast, **digital data** is either created by converting analog data to digital form (eg. images or videos) or is the native product of a digital system, such as logs from a mobile app or syntetic data.
