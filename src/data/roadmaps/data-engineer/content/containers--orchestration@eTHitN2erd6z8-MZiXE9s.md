# Containers & Orchestration

**Containers** are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that package applications and their dependencies, enabling consistent deployment across different computing environments. They encapsulate software code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings, ensuring that the application runs the same regardless of where it's deployed. Containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them more efficient than traditional virtual machines. 

**Orchestration** refers to the automated coordination and management of complex IT systems. It involves combining multiple automated tasks and processes into a single workflow to achieve a specific goal. Orchestration is one of the key components of any software development process and it should never be avoided nor preferred over manual configuration. As an automation practice, orchestration helps to remove the chance of human error from the different steps of the data engineering lifecycle. This is all to ensure efficient resource utilization and consistency.
