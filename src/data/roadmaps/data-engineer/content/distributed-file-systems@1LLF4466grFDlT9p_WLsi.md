# Distributed File Systems

A Distributed File System (DFS) allows multiple computers to access and share files across a network as if they were stored on a single local machine. It distributes data across multiple servers, enhancing accessibility and data redundancy. This enables users to access files from various locations and devices, promoting collaboration and data availability.
