# IoT

IoT, or Internet of Things, defines a network of connected devices interacting with their environment. IoT devices extend beyond standard devices such as PC's, Laptops or Smartphones, including smart locks, connected thermostats and temperature sensors. In industrial settings, this also includes connected machines, robots, and package tracking devices, and many more. IoT Devices measure and collect data about their environment and some also interact by performing certain predefined actions, for example turning the heat up or down.
