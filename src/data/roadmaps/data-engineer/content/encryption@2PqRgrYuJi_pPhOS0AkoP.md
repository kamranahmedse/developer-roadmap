# Encryption

Encryption is used to protect data from being stolen, changed, or compromised and works by scrambling data into a secret code that can only be unlocked with a unique digital key. Encrypted data can be protected while at rest on computers or in transit between them, or while being processed, regardless of whether those computers are located on-premises or are remote cloud servers.
