# Monitoring

Monitoring involves continuously observing and tracking the performance, availability, and health of systems, applications, and infrastructure. It typically includes collecting and analyzing metrics, logs, and events to ensure systems are operating within desired parameters. Monitoring helps detect anomalies, identify potential issues before they escalate, and provides insights into system behavior. It often involves tools and platforms that offer dashboards, alerts, and reporting features to facilitate real-time visibility and proactive management. Effective monitoring is crucial for maintaining system reliability, performance, and for supporting incident response and troubleshooting.

A few popular tools are Prometheus, Sentry, Datadog, and NewRelic.
