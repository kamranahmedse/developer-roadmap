# Star vs Snowflake Schema

A star schema is a way to organize data in a database, namely in data warehouses, to make it easier and faster to analyze. At the center, there's a main table called the **fact table**, which holds measurable data like sales or revenue. Around it are **dimension tables**, which add details like product names, customer info, or dates. This layout forms a star-like shape.

A snowflake schema is another way of organizing data. In this schema, dimension tables are split into smaller sub-dimensions to keep data more organized and detailed, just like snowflakes in a large lake.

The star schema is simple and fast -ideal when you need to extract data for analysis quickly. On the other hand, the snowflake schema is more detailed. It prioritizes storage efficiency and managing complex data relationships.
