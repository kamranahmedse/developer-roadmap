# Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow is an open-source tool that helps you schedule, organize, and monitor workflows. Think of it like a to-do list for your data tasks, but smarter — you can set tasks to run in a specific order, track their progress, and see what happens if something fails. It’s often used for automating data pipelines so that data moves, gets processed, and is ready for use without manual work.
