# NoSQL databases

NoSQL databases are a category of database management systems designed for handling unstructured, semi-structured, or rapidly changing data. Unlike traditional relational databases, which use fixed schemas and SQL for querying, NoSQL databases offer flexible data models and can be classified into several types:

1.  **Document Stores**: Store data in JSON, BSON, or XML formats, allowing for flexible and hierarchical data structures (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB).
2.  **Key-Value Stores**: Store data as key-value pairs, suitable for high-speed read and write operations (e.g., Redis, Riak).
3.  **Column-Family Stores**: Store data in columns rather than rows, which is useful for handling large volumes of data and wide columnar tables (e.g., Apache Cassandra, HBase).
4.  **Graph Databases**: Optimize the storage and querying of data with complex relationships using graph structures (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune).

NoSQL databases are often used for applications requiring high scalability, flexibility, and performance, such as real-time analytics, content management systems, and distributed data storage.
