# Infrastructure as Code - IaC

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the ability to provision and support your computing infrastructure using code instead of manual processes and settings. Manual infrastructure management is time-consuming and prone to error—especially when you manage applications at scale. Infrastructure as code lets you define your infrastructure's desired state without including all the steps to get to that state. It automates infrastructure management so developers can focus on building and improving applications instead of managing environments. Organizations use infrastructure as code to control costs, reduce risks, and respond with speed to new business opportunities.
