# EU AI Act

he Artificial Intelligence Act of the European Union, also known as the EU AI Act, is a comprehensive regulatory framework that is established to ensure safety and that fundamental human rights are upheld in the use of AI technologies. It governs the development and/or use of AI in the European Union. The act takes a risk-based approach to regulation, applying different rules to AI systems according to the risk they pose.

Considered the world's first comprehensive regulatory framework for AI, the EU AI Act prohibits some AI uses outright and implements strict governance, risk management and transparency requirements for others.
