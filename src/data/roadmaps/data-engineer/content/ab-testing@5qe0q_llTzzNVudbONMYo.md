# A/B Testing

A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of something to see which one works better. You split your audience into two groups, one sees version A, the other sees version B â€” and then you measure which version gets better results, like more clicks, sales, or sign-ups. This helps you make decisions based on real data instead of guesses.
