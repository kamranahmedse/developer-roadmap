# Hybrid

Hybrid data ingestion combines aspects of both real-time and batch ingestion. This approach gives you the flexibility to adapt your data ingestion strategy as your needs evolve. For example, you could process data in real-time for critical applications and in batches for less time-sensitive tasks. Two common hybrid methods are Lambda architecture-based and micro-batching.
