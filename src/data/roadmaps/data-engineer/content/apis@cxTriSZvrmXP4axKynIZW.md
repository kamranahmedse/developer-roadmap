# APIs and Data Collection

Application Programming Interfaces, better known as APIs, play a fundamental role in the work of data engineers, particularly in the process of data collection. APIs are sets of protocols, routines, and tools that enable different software applications to communicate with each other. An API allows developers to interact with a service or platform through a defined set of rules and endpoints, enabling data exchange and functionality use without needing to understand the underlying code. In data engineering, APIs are used extensively to collect, exchange, and manipulate data from different sources in a secure and efficient manner.
