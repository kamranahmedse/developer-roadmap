# Document

**Document Databases are a type of No-SQL databases that store data in JSON, BSON, or XML formats, allowing for flexible, semi-structured and hierarchical data structures. These databases are characterized by their dynamic schema, scalability through distribution, and ability to intuitively map data models to application code. Popular examples include MongoDB, which allows for easy storage and retrieval of varied data types without requiring a rigid, predefined schema.
