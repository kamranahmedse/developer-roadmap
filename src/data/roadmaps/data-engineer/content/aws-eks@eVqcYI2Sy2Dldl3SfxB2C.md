# EKS

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications using Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration platform. EKS manages the Kubernetes control plane for the user, making it easy to run Kubernetes applications without the operational overhead of maintaining the Kubernetes control plane. With EKS, you can leverage AWS services such as Auto Scaling Groups, Elastic Load Balancer, and Route 53 for resilient and scalable application infrastructure. Additionally, EKS can support Spot and On-Demand instances use, and includes integrations with AWS App Mesh service and AWS Fargate for serverless compute.
