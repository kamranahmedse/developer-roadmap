# Types of Data Ingestion

The primary types of data ingestion are Batch, Streaming, and Hybrid. Batch ingestion processes data in large, scheduled chunks, suitable for non-time-sensitive tasks like monthly reports. Streaming (or Real-time) ingestion handles data as it arrives, ideal for time-sensitive applications such as fraud detection or IoT monitoring. Hybrid ingestion combines both methods, offering flexibility for diverse business needs.
