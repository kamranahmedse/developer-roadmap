# Testing

Testing is a systematic process used to evaluate the functionality, performance, and quality of software or systems to ensure they meet specified requirements and standards. It involves various methodologies and levels, including unit testing (testing individual components), integration testing (verifying interactions between components), system testing (assessing the entire system's behavior), and acceptance testing (confirming it meets user needs). Testing can be manual or automated and aims to identify defects, validate that features work as intended, and ensure the system performs reliably under different conditions. Effective testing is critical for delivering high-quality software and mitigating risks before deployment.
