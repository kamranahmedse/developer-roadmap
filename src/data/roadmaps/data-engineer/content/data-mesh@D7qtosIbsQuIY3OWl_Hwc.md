# Data Mesh

A data mesh is a modern approach to data architecture that shifts data management from a centralized model to a decentralized one. It emphasizes domain-oriented ownership, where data management aligns with specific business areas. This alignment makes data operations more scalable and flexible, leveraging the knowledge and expertise of those closest to the data. Data mesh is defined by four principles: data domains, data products, self-serve data platform, and federated computational governance.
