# Async vs Sync Communication

Synchronous and asynchronous data refer to different approaches in data transmission and processing. **Synchronous** ingestion is a process where the system waits for a response from the data source before proceeding. In contrast, **asynchronous** ingestion is a process where data is ingested without waiting for a response from the data source. Normally, data is queued in a buffer and sent in batches for efficiency.

Each approach has its benefits and drawbacks, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of the data ingestion process and the business needs.
