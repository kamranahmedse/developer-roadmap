# Container Registries

A **Container Registry** is a centralized storage and distribution system for Docker container images. It allows developers to easily share and deploy applications in the form of these images. Container registries play a crucial role in the deployment of containerized applications, as they provide a fast, reliable, and secure way to distribute container images across various production environments.

Below is a list of popular container registries available today:

- **Docker Hub**: Docker Hub is the default registry for public Docker images and serves as a platform for sharing and distributing images among developers.

- **Artifact Registry**: Artifact Registry is a managed container registry provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offering private storage and distribution of container images.

- **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**: Amazon ECR is a fully-managed Docker container registry provided by Amazon Web Services, offering high scalability and performance for storing, managing, and deploying container images.

- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: ACR is a managed registry provided by Microsoft Azure, offering Geo-replication, access control, and integration with other Azure services.
