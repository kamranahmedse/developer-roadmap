# Containers

Containers are isolated, lightweight environments that run applications using a shared operating system kernel, ensuring consistency and portability across different computing environments. They encapsulate everything needed to run an application, such as code, dependencies, and configurations, making it easy to move and run the containerized application anywhere. Using the Docker CLI, you can create, start, stop, and manage containers with commands like `docker run`, `docker ps` to list running containers, `docker stop` to halt them, and `docker exec` to interact with them in real time. The CLI provides a powerful interface for developers to build, control, and debug containers effortlessly, allowing for streamlined development and operational workflows.
