# Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous integration is the idea of executing some actions (for example build, test, etc...) automatically as you push code to your version control system.

For containers, there are a number of things we may want to do:

- Build the container images
- Execute tests
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities
- Tag images with useful metadata
- Push to a container registry
