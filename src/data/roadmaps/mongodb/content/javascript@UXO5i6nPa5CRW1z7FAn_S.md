# JavaScript

The JavaScript data type in MongoDB allows you to store JavaScript code as BSON values within documents, enabling the execution of server-side JavaScript functions for operations like map-reduce, stored procedures, and complex data transformations. This type can store JavaScript functions or code snippets that can be executed within the MongoDB server environment, making it useful for scenarios where you need to perform complex calculations, business logic, or custom aggregation operations directly on the database server. However, the JavaScript type is primarily legacy functionality and is generally discouraged in modern MongoDB applications due to security concerns and performance implications, with the aggregation framework being the preferred approach for complex data processing tasks that previously required server-side JavaScript execution.
