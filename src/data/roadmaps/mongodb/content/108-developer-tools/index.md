# Developer Tools

This section explores the essential developer tools you need when working with MongoDB. These developer tools aim to help you manage, interact, and visualize your data to make development tasks quicker and easier.

## MongoDB Shell (mongo)

MongoDB Shell, also known as `mongo`, is a command-line interface that allows you to interact with a MongoDB instance. You can use the `mongo` shell to perform CRUD operations, administrative tasks, and manage your databases.

```bash
mongo [options] [db address]
```
