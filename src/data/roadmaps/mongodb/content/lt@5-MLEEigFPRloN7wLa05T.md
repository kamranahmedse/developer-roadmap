# $lt

The $lt (less than) operator in MongoDB selects documents where a field value is less than a specified value. It supports comparison operations on numbers, dates, strings, and other ordered BSON types. $lt is commonly used in range queries, date boundaries, and filtering datasets by numeric thresholds. It combines well with $gt to create range-based queries.
