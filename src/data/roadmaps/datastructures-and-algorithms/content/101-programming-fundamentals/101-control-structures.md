# Control Structures

Control structures are fundamental elements in most programming languages that facilitate the flow of control through a program. There are three main types of control structures: Sequential, Selection and Iteration.
- **Sequential** control structures are the default mode where instructions happen one after another.
- **Selection** control structures (often called "conditional" or "decision" structures) allow one set of instructions to be executed if a condition is true and another if it's false. These typically include `if...else` statements.
- **Iteration** control structures (also known as _loops_) allow a block of code to be repeated multiple times. Common loop structures include `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops. All these control structures play a vital role in shaping the program logic.
