# Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms follow the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. They are used for optimization problems. An optimal solution is one where the value of the solution is either maximum or minimum. These algorithms work in a " greedy" manner by choosing the best option at the current, disregarding any implications on the future steps. This can lead to solutions that are less optimal. Examples of problems solved by greedy algorithms are Kruskal's minimal spanning tree algorithm, Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and the Knapsack problem.
