# Fast and Slow Pointers


The **fast and slow pointer technique** (also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm) is a variation of the two-pointer strategy, mainly used with linked lists and sometimes arrays.  
It involves two pointers starting at the same position â€” the **slow pointer** moves one step at a time, while the **fast pointer** moves two steps at a time.  
This method is commonly used for detecting cycles in linked lists, finding the middle node,checks whether the given numner is happy number or not and solving problems efficiently in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space.
