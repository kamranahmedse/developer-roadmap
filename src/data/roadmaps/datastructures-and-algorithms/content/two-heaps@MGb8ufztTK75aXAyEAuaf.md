# Two Heaps
A method that uses both a min-heap and a max-heap to store the same elements. This lets you quickly find the smallest and largest values in constant time, while insertions and deletions still take logarithmic time. The trade-off of storing the same elements is that each operation has to be done in both heaps, which can make updates a little more complex.
