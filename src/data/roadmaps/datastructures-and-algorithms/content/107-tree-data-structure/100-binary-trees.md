# Binary Trees

A **Binary Tree** is a type of tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This distinguishes it from trees in which nodes can have any number of children. A binary tree is further classified as a strictly binary tree if every non-leaf node in the tree has non-empty left and right child nodes. A binary tree is complete if all levels of the tree, except possibly the last, are fully filled, and all nodes are as left-justified as possible. Multiple algorithms and functions employ binary trees due to their suitable properties for mathematical operations and data organization.
