# Networking

Linux networking enables system connections and resource sharing across platforms with robust management tools. Network configurations stored in `/etc/network/interfaces`. Key commands include `ifconfig` (deprecated) and `ip` for interface management. Supports various protocols with excellent scalability. Essential for system connectivity and network troubleshooting. Linux adopts a file-based approach for network configuration, storing network-related settings and configurations in standard files, such as `/etc/network/interfaces` or `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/`, depending on the Linux distribution.
