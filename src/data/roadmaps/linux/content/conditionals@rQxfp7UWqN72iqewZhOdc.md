# Conditionals

Shell conditionals allow scripts to make decisions based on conditions using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. These control process flow by evaluating string variables, arithmetic tests, or process status. Conditions are checked sequentially - if true, the corresponding code block executes; otherwise, it moves to the next condition until finding a match or reaching `else`.
