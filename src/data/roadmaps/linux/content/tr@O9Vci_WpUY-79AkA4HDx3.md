# Tr-Command

The `tr` command in Linux is a command-line utility that translates or substitutes characters. It reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output. Although commonly used for translation applications, `tr` has versatile functionality in the text processing aspect of Linux. Ranging from replacing a list of characters, to deleting or squeezing character repetitions, `tr` presents a robust tool for stream-based text manipulations.

Here's a basic usage example:

```bash
echo 'hello' | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'
```

In this example, `tr` is used to convert the lowercase 'hello' to uppercase 'HELLO'. It's an essential tool for text processing tasks in the Linux environment.
