# SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol providing secure remote access, command execution, and data communication between networked computers. Replaces insecure protocols like Telnet with confidentiality, integrity, and security. Use `ssh username@server_ip_address` to connect to remote Linux servers. Essential for secure system administration and remote management.
