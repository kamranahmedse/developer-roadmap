# AWK

AWK is a powerful text-processing language for Unix-like systems, named after its creators Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan. It reads files line by line, identifies patterns, and executes actions on matches. Commonly used in bash scripts for sorting, filtering, and report generation.

Example: `awk '{print $1,$2}' filename` prints first two fields of each line.
