Filesystems define how files are stored and organized on Linux storage disks, ensuring data integrity, reliability, and efficient access. Linux supports various types like EXT4, XFS, BTRFS with different performance and recovery capabilities. All files start from root directory '/'. Use `df -T` to display filesystem types and disk usage status. Essential for Linux administration tasks.
