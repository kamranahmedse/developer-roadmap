# join Command

`join` is a powerful text processing command in Linux. It lets you combine lines of two files on a common field, which works similar to the 'Join' operation in SQL. It's particularly useful when you're dealing with large volumes of data. Specifically, `join` uses the lines from two files to form lines that contain pairs of lines related in a meaningful way.
