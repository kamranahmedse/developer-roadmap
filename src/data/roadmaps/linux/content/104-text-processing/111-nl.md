# Introduction to NL (Number Lines)

`nl` command in Linux is a utility for numbering lines in a text file. Also known as 'number lines', it can be handy when you need an overview where certain lines in a file are located. By default, nl number the non-empty lines only, but this behavior can be modified based on user's needs.

It follows a syntax like this:

```bash
nl [options] [file_name]
```

If no file is specified, `nl` will wait for input from user's terminal (stdin). Its clear and readable output makes it a valuable part of any Linux user's text processing toolkit.
