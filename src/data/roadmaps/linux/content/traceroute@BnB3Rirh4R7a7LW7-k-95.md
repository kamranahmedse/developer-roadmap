# Traceroute

Traceroute is a Linux network diagnostic tool that displays the path packets take from your system to a destination. It identifies routing problems, measures latency, and reveals network structure as packets traverse the internet. Each hop is tested multiple times with round-trip times displayed. Use `traceroute www.example.com` to discover packet routes and diagnose failures.
