# Loops

Shell loops automate repetitive tasks with three types: `for` (iterates over lists), `while` (executes while condition true), `until` (runs until condition true). Example: `for i in 1 2 3; do echo "$i"; done` outputs each number. Essential for script efficiency, automation, and effective Linux shell programming.
