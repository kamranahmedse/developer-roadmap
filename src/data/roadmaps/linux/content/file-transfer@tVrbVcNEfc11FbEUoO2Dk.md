# File Transfer

Linux file transfer involves copying or moving files between systems over networks. Command-line tools support protocols like FTP, HTTP, SCP, SFTP, and NFS. Common commands include `scp`, `rsync`, and `wget`. Example: `scp /local/file username@remote:/destination` copies files to remote systems. These tools make network file sharing streamlined, easier, and more secure.
