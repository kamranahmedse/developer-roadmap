# Running Services

Linux servers run various services including web, database, DNS, and mail servers. System administrators use tools like `systemctl`, `service`, `netstat`, `ss`, and `lsof` to manage and monitor services. Use `systemctl --type=service` to list all active services with their status. Essential for server management, resource monitoring, and troubleshooting.
