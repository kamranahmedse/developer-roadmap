# Paste

In Linux, paste is a powerful text processing utility that is primarily used for merging lines from multiple files. It allows users to combine data by columns rather than rows, adding immense flexibility to textual data manipulation. Users can choose a specific delimiter for separating columns, providing a range of ways to format the output. You may use `paste` command like `$ paste file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt`.
