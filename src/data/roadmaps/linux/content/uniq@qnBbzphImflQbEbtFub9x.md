# Uniq

`uniq` is an extremely useful command-line program for text processing. It aids in the examination and manipulation of text files by comparing or filtering out repeated lines that are adjacent. Whether you're dealing with a list of data or a large text document, the `uniq` command allows you to find and filter out duplicate lines, or even provide a count of each unique line in a file. It's important to remember that `uniq` only removes duplicates that are next to each other, so to get the most out of this command, data is often sorted using the `sort` command first.
