# Vim: An Essential Tool for Editing Files

Vim (Vi Improved) is a powerful and flexible text editor used in Unix-like systems. It builds on the original Vi editor with additional features and improvements, including multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, and an extensive set of commands for text manipulation.

Vim operates primarily in three modes:

- Normal (for navigation and manipulation).
- Insert (for editing text).
- Command (for executing commands).
