# User Management

Linux operating system offers a structured user management system, allowing multiple users to interact with the same system in an isolated manner. This includes defining user roles, assigning permissions, groups, ownership and other related aspects, which are crucial tasks for Linux administrators.

For smoother and controlled operation, user management in Linux includes tasks such as creating, deleting, modifying users and groups. It also involves assigning permissions and ownership of files and directories to users/groups.

Basic shell commands are a fundamental part of user management in Linux. For example, `adduser` or `useradd` is used to create a new user on a system:

```bash
sudo adduser newuser
```

Similarly, `deluser` or `userdel` is used to remove a user:

```bash
sudo deluser newuser
```

The entire concept of user management circles around providing proper accessibility, and maintaining the security of the Linux operating system. Other commands such as `passwd` for password management or `su` for switching users further emphasize the depth and importance of user management in Linux.
