# Working with Files

Working with files is an essential part of Linux and it's a skill every Linux user must have. In Linux, everything is considered a file: texts, images, systems, devices, and directories.
Linux provides multiple command-line utilities to create, view, move or search files. Some of the basic commands for file handling in Linux terminal include `touch` for creating files, `mv` for moving files, `cp` for copying files, `rm` for removing files, and `ls` for listing files and directories.

For instance, to create a file named "example.txt", we use the command:

```bash
touch example.txt
```

To list files in the current directory, we use the command:

```bash
ls
```

Knowing how to effectively manage and manipulate files in Linux is crucial for administering and running a successful Linux machine.
