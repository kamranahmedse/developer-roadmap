# Literals

Shell literals are fixed values in source code including string literals (enclosed in quotes), numeric literals (sequences of digits), and boolean literals (1=true, 0=false). String examples: 'Hello, world!' or "Hello, world!". Numeric examples: 25, 100, 1234. Understanding literals is fundamental for shell scripting readability and functionality in Linux programming.
