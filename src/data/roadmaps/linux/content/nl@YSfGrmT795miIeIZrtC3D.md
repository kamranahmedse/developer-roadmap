# NL (Number Lines)

The `nl` command numbers lines in text files, providing an overview of line locations. By default, it numbers only non-empty lines, but this behavior can be modified. Syntax: `nl [options] [file_name]`. If no file is specified, nl reads from stdin. Valuable for text processing when line numbers are needed for reference or debugging purposes.
