# Users and Groups

User management in Linux uses groups to organize users and manage permissions efficiently. Groups are collections of users that simplify system administration by controlling access to resources like files and directories. Users can belong to multiple groups, enabling precise privilege management. Commands like `groupadd`, `groupdel`, `groupmod`, `usermod`, and `gpasswd` manage groups effectively. Proper group management is crucial for a secure and organized system environment.
