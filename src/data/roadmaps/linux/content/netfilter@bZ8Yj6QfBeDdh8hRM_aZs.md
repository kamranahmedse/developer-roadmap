# Netfilter

Netfilter is a Linux kernel framework for manipulating and filtering network packets with hooks at various stages (pre-routing, input, forward, output, post-routing). Used for firewalls and NAT management with iptables configuration. Essential for traffic control, packet modification, logging, and intrusion detection in Linux networking systems.
