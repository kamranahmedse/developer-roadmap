# Ping

The `ping` command is essential for Linux network troubleshooting, checking connectivity between your host and target machines. It sends ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets and listens for ECHO_RESPONSE returns, providing insights into connection health and speed. Use `ping <target IP or hostname>` to diagnose network connectivity issues and identify reachability problems efficiently.
