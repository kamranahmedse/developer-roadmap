# PL/pgSQL - Procedural Language for PostgreSQL

`PL/pgSQL` is a procedural language for the PostgreSQL database system that enables you to create stored procedures and functions using conditionals, loops, and other control structures, similar to a traditional programming language. Using PL/pgSQL, you can perform complex operations on the server-side, reducing the need to transfer data between the server and client. This can significantly improve performance, and it enables you to encapsulate and modularize your logic within the database.
