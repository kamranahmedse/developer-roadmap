# Ansible for PostgreSQL Configuration Management

Ansible is a widely used open-source configuration management and provisioning tool that helps automate many tasks for managing servers, databases, and applications. It uses a simple, human-readable language called YAML to define automation scripts, known as “playbooks”. By using Ansible playbooks and PostgreSQL modules, you can automate repetitive tasks, ensure consistent configurations, and reduce human error.
