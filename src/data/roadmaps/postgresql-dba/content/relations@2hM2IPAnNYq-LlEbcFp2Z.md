# Relations in the Relational Model

In the relational model, a relation is essentially a table composed of rows and columns, where each row represents a unique record (or tuple) and each column represents an attribute of the data. The structure of a relation is defined by its schema, which specifies the relation's name and the names and data types of its attributes. Relations are governed by integrity constraints, such as domain constraints, key constraints, and referential integrity constraints, to ensure data accuracy and consistency. Operations like selection, projection, join, and others can be performed on relations to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently.
