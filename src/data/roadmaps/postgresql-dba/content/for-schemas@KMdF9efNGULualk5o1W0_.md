# Schemas in PostgreSQL

A schema is a logical collection of database objects within a PostgreSQL database. It behaves like a namespace that allows you to group and isolate your database objects separately from other schemas. The primary goal of a schema is to organize your database structure, making it easier to manage and maintain. By default, every PostgreSQL database has a `public` schema, which is the default search path for any unqualified table or other database object.
