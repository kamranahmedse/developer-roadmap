`iotop` is an essential command-line utility that provides real-time insights into the input/output (I/O) activities of processes running on your system. This tool is particularly useful when monitoring and managing your PostgreSQL database's performance, as it helps system administrators or database developers to identify processes with high I/O, leading to potential bottlenecks or server optimization opportunities.
