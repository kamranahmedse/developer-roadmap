# User Specified Errors

User specified errors can be created by extending the base Error object, a built-in error class. When creating errors in this manner, you should pass a message string that describes the error. This message can be accessed through the message property on the object. The Error object also contains a name and a stack property that indicate the name of the error and the point in the code at which it is created.
