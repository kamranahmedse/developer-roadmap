# Making API calls with HTTP

You can make API calls using the `http` module in Node.js as well. Here are the two methods that you can use:

*   `http.get()` - Make http GET requests.
*   `http.request()` - Similar to `http.get()` but enables sending other types of http requests (GET requests inclusive).
