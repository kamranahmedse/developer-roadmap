# Using Debugger

Node.js includes a command-line debugging utility. The Node.js debugger client is not a full-featured debugger, but simple stepping and inspection are possible. To use it, start Node.js with the inspect argument followed by the path to the script to debug.

Example - `$ node inspect myscript.js`
