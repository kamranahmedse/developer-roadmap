# ESM

ESM (ECMAScript Modules) is a standardized module system in JavaScript that allows for the organized, maintainable, and reusable structuring of code. It uses import and export statements for including and sharing functions, objects, or primitives between files. ESM supports static analysis, enabling better optimization and tooling, and is always in strict mode to reduce common JavaScript issues. Node.js fully supports ESM, which can be used with .mjs file extensions or configured in the package.json for .js files, making it easier to write modular and efficient JavaScript applications.
