# History of Node.js

Node.js was written initially by Ryan Dahl in 2009, about thirteen years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web. The initial release supported only Linux and macOS X. Its development and maintenance were led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.
