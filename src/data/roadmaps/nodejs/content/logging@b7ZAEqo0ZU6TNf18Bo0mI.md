# Node.js Logging

**Logging** is an essential part of understanding the complete application life cycle of the `Node.js` application. We can much more easily and quickly fix errors by looking at logs throughout the development process, from creating to debugging to designing new features. **Error**, **warn**, **info**, and **debug** are the four basic logging levels in `Node.js`. Logging involves persistently collecting information about an application's runtime behaviour.
