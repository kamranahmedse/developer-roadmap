# process.stdin

`process.stdin` is a stream in Node.js that represents the standard input, typically the keyboard. It allows your Node.js programs to receive text input from the command line. The `readline` module provides a convenient interface for reading input from `process.stdin` line by line, making it easier to handle user input in interactive command-line applications.
