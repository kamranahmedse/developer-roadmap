# System Errors

Node.js generates system errors when exceptions occur within its runtime environment. These usually occur when an application violates an operating system constraint. For example, a system error will occur if an application attempts to read a file that does not exist.

Below are the system errors commonly encountered when writing a Node.js program:

1.  EACCES - Permission denied
2.  EADDRINUSE - Address already in use
3.  ECONNRESET - Connection reset by peer
4.  EEXIST - File exists
5.  EISDIR - Is a directory
6.  EMFILE - Too many open files in system
7.  ENOENT - No such file or directory
8.  ENOTDIR - Not a directory
9.  ENOTEMPTY - Directory not empty
10.  ENOTFOUND - DNS lookup failed
11.  EPERM - Operation not permitted
12.  EPIPE - Broken Pipe
13.  ETIMEDOUT - Operation timed out
