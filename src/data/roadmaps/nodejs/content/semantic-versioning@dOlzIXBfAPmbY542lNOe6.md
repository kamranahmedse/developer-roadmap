# Semantic Versioning

Semantic Versioning is a standard for versioning software that's widely adopted in the npm ecosystem. It provides a clear and consistent way to communicate changes in a software package to users.

## Version Format

A semantic version number consists of three parts separated by dots:

- MAJOR: Incremented when there are incompatible API changes.
- MINOR: Incremented when new functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner.
- PATCH: Incremented when bug fixes are made without affecting the API.

### Example: 1.2.3

- 1 is the major version.
- 2 is the minor version.
- 3 is the patch version.
