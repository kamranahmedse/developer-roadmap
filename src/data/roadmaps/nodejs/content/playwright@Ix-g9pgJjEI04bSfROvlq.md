# Playwright

Playwright is an open-source automation library developed by Microsoft for testing and automating web applications. 1 It offers a unified API to control Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers, making it a versatile choice for cross-browser testing.

Playwright provides a high-level API to interact with web pages. You can write scripts to simulate user actions, such as clicking buttons, filling forms, and navigating through different pages. Playwright handles the underlying browser interactions, making it easy to write and maintain tests.
