# Http module

To make HTTP requests in Node.js, there is a built-in module HTTP in Node.js to transfer data over the HTTP. To use the HTTP server in node, we need to require the HTTP module using `require()` method. The HTTP module creates an HTTP server that listens to server ports and gives a response back to the client.
