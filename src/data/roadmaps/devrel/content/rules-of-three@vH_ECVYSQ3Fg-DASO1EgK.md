# Rules of Three

Ever notice how the most memorable speeches, stories, and jokes often come in threes? "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Or "Build. Measure. Learn." That is no accident. Its the Rule of Three in action.

In public speaking, the Rule of Three is a simple but powerful principle: ideas presented in threes are more engaging, memorable, and persuasive. Our brains are wired to recognize patterns, and three is the smallest number that forms a complete set. One feels incomplete, two feels like a comparison, but three creates rhythm and impact.

As a Developer Advocate, whether you are explaining a concept on stage, demoing a product, or even writing docs, using the Rule of Three helps you connect with your audience and land your message effectively.

So next time you are preparing a talk, remember: say it once, say it twice, say it right—three times.
