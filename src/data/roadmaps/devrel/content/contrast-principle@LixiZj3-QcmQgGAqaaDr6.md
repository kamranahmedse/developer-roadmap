# Contrast Principle

The contrast principle is a psychological concept where the perception of something is influenced by what came before it. In practical terms, it means that when two items are presented one after the other, the differences between them seem more pronounced. For example, if a developer sees a complex solution first, a simpler one that follows will appear even easier than it would on its own. This principle is often used in marketing, presentations, and negotiations to shape how choices are perceived, making certain options more attractive by strategically setting up contrasts.
