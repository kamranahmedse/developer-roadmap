# VS Code

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) was first announced by Microsoft in 2015 and quickly became one of the most popular and widely used Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Built on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), a framework that allows web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create desktop applications, VSCode offers a lightweight and highly extensible platform for developers.

Unlike traditional, full-featured IDEs, VSCode focuses on being a streamlined code editor with the ability to install extensions that add features such as debugging, version control, and language-specific tooling. Microsoft's vision was to create a flexible environment that could cater to all types of developers, from beginners to seasoned professionals.

Over time, VSCode has evolved with powerful built-in features like [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense), an integrated terminal, [Git](https://git-scm.com/) support, and remote development capabilities. It supports numerous programming languages and can be customized with themes, plugins, and settings to fit a wide range of development workflows.
