# Importance of DevRel

Developer Relations (DevRel) is crucial for fostering a vibrant and engaged developer community around a product or platform. It involves creating and maintaining strong relationships with developers through activities like community building, technical support, advocacy, and education. Effective DevRel ensures that developers have the resources and support they need to succeed, which in turn drives product adoption, innovation, and loyalty. By bridging the gap between a company's development teams and external developers, DevRel can also provide valuable feedback for product improvements and help in shaping the future direction of the product or platform.
