# Integral Calculus:

Integral calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the calculation of integrals, which are used to determine the area under curves, volumes of solid objects, and many other physical quantities. Indefinite integrals are used to find the antiderivative of a function, while definite integrals are used to find the area under a curve between two points. There are several techniques for solving integrals, including substitution, integration by parts, trigonometric substitution, and partial fraction decomposition.
