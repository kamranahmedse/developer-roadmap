# Lagrangian Distribution Resource

The Lagrangian distribution is a probability distribution used in statistics and probability theory. Here are some key points about the Lagrangian distribution:
It is a continuous probability distribution with a support on the real line.It is also known as the log-normal-Poisson distribution or the doubly truncated Poisson distribution.It is often used to model count data that has an upper and/or lower limit.The distribution has two parameters: mu and sigma, which represent the mean and standard deviation of the underlying log-normal distribution.Examples of its application include modeling the distribution of cell counts in biology, modeling the distribution of time between events in a Poisson process, and modeling the distribution of earthquake magnitudes.
