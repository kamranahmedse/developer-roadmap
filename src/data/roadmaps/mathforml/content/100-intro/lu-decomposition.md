# LU Decomposition:

In linear algebra, LU Decomposition, i.e., lower–upper (LU) decomposition or factorization of a matrix, can be defined as the product of a lower and an upper triangular matrices. This product sometimes comprises a permutation matrix as well. We can relate the LU decomposition method with the matrix form of the Gaussian elimination method of solving a system of linear equations
