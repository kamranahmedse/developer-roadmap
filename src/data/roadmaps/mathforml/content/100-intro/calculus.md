# Calculus

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of rates of change, and the accumulation of small changes over time. It is a powerful tool for understanding and describing the behavior of mathematical functions, and has numerous applications in physics, engineering, economics, and many other field.
Calculus is an important mathematical tool for machine learning (ML) because it provides the necessary mathematical framework for understanding the optimization algorithms that are commonly used in ML.
