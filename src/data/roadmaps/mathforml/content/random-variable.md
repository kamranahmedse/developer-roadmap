# Random Variable Resource

Random variables are mathematical functions that associate each outcome of a random process with a numerical value.
They are used to represent uncertain quantities in probability theory and statistics, and are essential for modeling and analyzing many real-world phenomena.A random variable can be discrete, taking on only a countable number of possible values, or continuous, taking on values from a continuous range.The distribution of a random variable describes the probabilities associated with each possible value, and can be characterized by various measures such as the mean, variance, and probability density function. We can define a random variable X to be the number that appears on the top face of the die after it is rolled. The possible values of X are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and each value has a probability of 1/6. The distribution of X is known as a discrete uniform distribution, which means that each possible outcome has an equal probability of occurring. We can use the expected value of X (which is 3.5) and the variance of X (which is 35/12 or approximately 2.92) to make predictions about the outcomes of future rolls of the die.
