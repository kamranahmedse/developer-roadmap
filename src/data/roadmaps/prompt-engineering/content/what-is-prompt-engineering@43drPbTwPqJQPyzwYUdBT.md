# What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective input text to guide AI language models toward desired outputs. It involves designing prompts that communicate intent clearly to get accurate, relevant responses. This iterative process requires understanding how LLMs work as prediction engines and using techniques to optimize their performance for specific tasks.
