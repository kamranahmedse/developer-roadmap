# One-Shot & Few-Shot Prompting

One-shot provides a single example to guide model behavior, while few-shot includes multiple examples (3-5) to demonstrate desired patterns. Examples show output structure, style, and tone, increasing accuracy and consistency. Use few-shot for complex formatting, specialized tasks, and when zero-shot results are inconsistent.
