# ReAct Prompting

ReAct (Reason and Act) prompting enables LLMs to solve complex tasks by combining reasoning with external tool interactions. It follows a thought-action-observation loop: analyze the problem, perform actions using external APIs, review results, and iterate until solved. Useful for research, multi-step problems, and tasks requiring current data.
