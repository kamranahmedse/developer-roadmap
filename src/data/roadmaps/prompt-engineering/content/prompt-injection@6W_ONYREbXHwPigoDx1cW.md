Prompt injection is a security vulnerability where malicious users manipulate LLM inputs to override intended behavior, bypass safety measures, or extract sensitive information. Attackers embed instructions within data to make models ignore original prompts and follow malicious commands. Mitigation requires input sanitization, injection-resistant prompt design, and proper security boundaries.
