# Role Prompting

Role prompting assigns a specific character, identity, or professional role to the LLM to generate responses consistent with that role's expertise, personality, and communication style. By establishing roles like "teacher," "travel guide," or "software engineer," you provide the model with appropriate domain knowledge, perspective, and tone for more targeted, natural interactions.
