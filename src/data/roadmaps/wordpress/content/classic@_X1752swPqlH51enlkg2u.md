# Classic Themes

Classic Themes in WordPress represent the traditional way of designing and structuring a WordPress website, relying heavily on PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within the theme files themselves. These themes typically involve a more direct approach to coding and customization, often requiring developers to modify template files directly to alter the site's appearance and functionality. They offer a high degree of control but can also be more complex to manage and update compared to newer theme types.
