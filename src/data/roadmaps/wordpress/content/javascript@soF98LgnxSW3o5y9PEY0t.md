# JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language primarily used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It allows developers to create engaging user experiences by manipulating the content, style, and structure of web pages in response to user actions. It runs directly in the web browser, making it a fundamental technology for frontend web development.
