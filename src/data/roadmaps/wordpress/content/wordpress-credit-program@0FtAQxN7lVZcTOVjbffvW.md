# WordPress Credit Program

The WordPress Credit Program recognizes and rewards individuals who contribute to the WordPress open-source project. By participating in various activities like coding, testing, documentation, translation, and community support, contributors earn credits that are displayed on their [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org) profiles. This program is particularly relevant for students as it provides a structured way to gain practical experience, build a portfolio, and demonstrate their skills to potential employers within the WordPress ecosystem.
