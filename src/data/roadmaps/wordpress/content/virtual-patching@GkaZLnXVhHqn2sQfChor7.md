# Virtual Patching

Virtual patching is a security policy enforcement mechanism that addresses vulnerabilities in real-time. It involves deploying security rules to protect against known exploits, effectively shielding vulnerable systems without requiring immediate code modification. This approach acts as a temporary fix, providing a window for developers to apply permanent patches while mitigating the risk of exploitation.
