# Block Theme Styles

Block theme styles in WordPress are sets of pre-defined visual settings that control the look and feel of your website. They allow you to quickly change things like colors, typography, and spacing across your entire site without needing to write any code. These styles are applied to the blocks that make up your pages and posts, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.
