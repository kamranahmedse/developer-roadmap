# Customizer

The WordPress Customizer is a built-in interface that allows users to modify various aspects of their website's theme in a live preview environment. It provides a visual way to adjust settings like site identity, colors, menus, widgets, and more, seeing the changes reflected in real-time before publishing them. This tool simplifies the process of personalizing a theme without needing to directly edit code. The Customizer is primarily used by classic themes.
