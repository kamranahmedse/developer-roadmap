# Universal Themes

Universal themes were the initial iteration of themes designed specifically to leverage the power of WordPress's block editor (Gutenberg). They aimed to provide a seamless and consistent editing experience, allowing users to build entire websites using blocks, from headers and footers to page content, all within the editor interface. While mostly similar to block themes, the primary difference is that they still use the Customizer to edit certain aspects, like Menus.
