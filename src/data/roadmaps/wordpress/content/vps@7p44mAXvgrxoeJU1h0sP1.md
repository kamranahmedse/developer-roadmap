# VPS Hosting for WordPress

A Virtual Private Server (VPS) provides a virtualized server environment within a larger physical server. It offers more control and resources compared to shared hosting, as each VPS operates independently with its own operating system, dedicated storage, and allocated RAM. This isolation ensures that your website's performance isn't affected by other users on the same physical server.
