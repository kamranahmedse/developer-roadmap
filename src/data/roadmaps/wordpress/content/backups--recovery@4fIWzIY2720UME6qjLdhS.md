# WordPress Backups & Recovery

Backups in WordPress involve creating a copy of your website's files, database, themes, and plugins. This copy acts as a safety net, allowing you to restore your website to a previous working state if something goes wrong, such as a server crash, hacking attempt, or accidental data loss. Recovery is the process of using this backup to reinstate your website, minimizing downtime and data loss.
