# HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a website, using elements to define headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other components that a user sees in their browser. These elements are defined by tags, which tell the browser how to display the content.
