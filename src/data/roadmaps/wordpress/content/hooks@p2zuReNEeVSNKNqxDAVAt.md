# Hooks

Hooks are a way for WordPress developers to modify or extend the default behavior of WordPress without directly altering the core files. They essentially allow you to "hook into" specific points in the WordPress execution process and add your own code to be executed at those points. This makes WordPress highly customizable and extensible.
