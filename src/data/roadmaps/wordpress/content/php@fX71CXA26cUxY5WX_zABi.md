# PHP

PHP is a scripting language primarily used for web development. It's embedded within HTML, meaning you can weave PHP code directly into your web pages. When a user requests a page containing PHP code, the server processes the PHP, generates HTML, and sends that HTML to the user's browser. This allows for dynamic content generation, database interaction, and handling user input, making websites interactive and personalized.
