# Vulnerability Monitoring

Vulnerability monitoring is the process of continuously scanning and assessing systems, applications, and networks for known weaknesses or flaws that could be exploited by attackers. This involves identifying potential security gaps, tracking new vulnerabilities as they are discovered, and prioritizing remediation efforts to minimize risk. Effective vulnerability monitoring helps organizations proactively address security threats before they can be leveraged to compromise data or disrupt operations.
