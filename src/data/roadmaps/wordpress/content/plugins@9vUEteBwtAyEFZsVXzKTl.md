WordPress plugins are like add-ons for your WordPress website. They are pieces of software that you can upload and install to extend the functionality of your site. Think of them as apps for your website, allowing you to add features like contact forms, e-commerce capabilities, SEO tools, social media integration, and much more, without needing to write any code yourself.
