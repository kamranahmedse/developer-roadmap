# style.css in Classic WordPress Themes

The `style.css` file is the main stylesheet in a classic WordPress theme. It controls the visual appearance of your website, defining elements like colors, fonts, layout, and responsiveness. This file is also required for WordPress to recognize the theme and display its name and other metadata in the WordPress admin panel.
