# functions.php in Classic WordPress Themes

The `functions.php` file in a Classic WordPress theme acts as a plugin, adding custom functionality and features to your website. It's a powerful tool for modifying the behavior of your theme and WordPress itself, allowing you to define custom functions, hooks, filters, and more, without directly altering the core theme files.
