# Image Optimization

Image optimization involves reducing the file size of your images without significantly sacrificing their quality. This makes your website load faster, improves user experience, and can boost your search engine rankings. Techniques include compressing images, choosing the right file format (like JPEG for photos and PNG for graphics), resizing images to appropriate dimensions, and using lazy loading so images only load when they're visible on the screen.
