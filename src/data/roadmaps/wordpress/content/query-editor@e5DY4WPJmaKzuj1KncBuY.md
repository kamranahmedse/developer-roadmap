# Query Editor

The Query Editor in WordPress allows you to directly interact with your website's database. It provides a space to write and execute SQL queries, enabling you to retrieve, modify, or delete data stored within the WordPress database. This tool is useful for advanced users who need to perform specific database operations beyond the capabilities of the WordPress admin interface.
