Query Monitor is a free WordPress plugin designed for developers. It helps identify and debug performance bottlenecks by providing detailed information about database queries, PHP errors, hooks and actions, block editor blocks, enqueued scripts and stylesheets, HTTP API calls, and more. This allows developers to quickly pinpoint slow queries, problematic plugins, or inefficient theme code, leading to a faster and more stable WordPress site.
