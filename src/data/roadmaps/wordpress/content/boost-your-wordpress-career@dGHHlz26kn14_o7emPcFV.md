# Boosting Your WordPress Career

To elevate your WordPress career, consider contributing directly to the WordPress project. This can involve submitting code to WordPress Core, improving documentation, or helping with translations. Engaging with the WordPress community through forums, online groups, and local meetups provides valuable networking and learning opportunities. Attending WordCamps and local WordPress meetups offers chances to learn from experts, connect with other professionals, and stay updated on the latest trends and best practices.
