# Block Patterns

Block Patterns are pre-designed collections of blocks that you can quickly insert into your WordPress content. They offer a convenient way to create visually appealing layouts and sections without having to manually configure each block. Think of them as reusable templates for common design elements, saving you time and effort in building your website.
