# Block Theme Structure

Block themes in WordPress are structured around blocks, which are the fundamental units for building website content and layout. The theme's structure defines how these blocks are organized and rendered, encompassing template files, template parts, and the theme's `theme.json` file, which controls global styles and settings. This structure dictates the overall look and feel of the website, offering flexibility and customization through block-based editing.
