# AJAX in WordPress

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a web development technique that allows web pages to update content dynamically without requiring a full page reload. This is achieved by exchanging data with a server in the background, meaning parts of a webpage can be updated independently, leading to a smoother and more responsive user experience.
