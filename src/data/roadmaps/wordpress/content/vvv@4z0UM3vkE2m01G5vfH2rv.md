# VVV

VVV (Varying Vagrant Vagrants) is an open-source development environment specifically designed for WordPress. It provides a pre-configured virtual machine that includes everything you need to develop WordPress themes, plugins, and even WordPress core itself. This allows developers to create a consistent and isolated environment, minimizing compatibility issues and streamlining the development process.
