# Block Editor

The Block Editor, also known as Gutenberg, is the default content editor in WordPress. It allows users to create and format content using individual blocks, each representing a specific element like paragraphs, images, headings, or galleries. These blocks can be easily arranged and customized to build visually appealing and structured pages and posts.
