# Settings Page

A settings page in a plugin provides a user interface within the WordPress admin area where users can configure the plugin's options and customize its behavior. It allows plugin developers to expose various settings, such as API keys, display preferences, or feature toggles, in an organized and accessible way, enabling users to tailor the plugin to their specific needs.
