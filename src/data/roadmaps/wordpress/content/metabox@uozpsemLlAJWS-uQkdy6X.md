# Metabox

A metabox is a custom input panel added to the WordPress post or page editing screen. It allows users to enter or select additional data related to the content being created, such as specific details, settings, or options that go beyond the standard title and body text. This data is then stored and can be used to display information or modify the behavior of the website.
