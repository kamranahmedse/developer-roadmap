|# Template Tags

Template tags are PHP functions used within WordPress theme template files to retrieve and display dynamic data. They act as placeholders that are replaced with information from the WordPress database, such as post titles, content, author information, and more. Using template tags allows theme developers to create dynamic and flexible layouts without hardcoding specific values.
