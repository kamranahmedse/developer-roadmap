# Filters

Filters in WordPress are a way to modify data before it's saved to the database or displayed on the screen. They allow you to intercept and alter variables, text, or other types of data as it passes through WordPress's core functions, plugins, or themes. This provides a powerful mechanism for customizing WordPress's behavior without directly editing the core code.
