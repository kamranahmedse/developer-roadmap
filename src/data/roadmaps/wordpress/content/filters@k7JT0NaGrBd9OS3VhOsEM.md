# Filters

Filters in WordPress allow you to modify data as it's being processed. Think of them as checkpoints in the code where you can intercept a variable, change its value, and then pass it along to continue its journey. This lets you alter things like post content, excerpt text, or even options stored in the database without directly editing the core WordPress files or plugin code.
