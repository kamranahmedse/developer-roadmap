# How the Web Works

The internet functions through a network of interconnected computers that communicate using a standardized set of rules called protocols. When you type a website address (like google.com) into your browser, your computer sends a request to a server that hosts the website. This server then sends back the website's files, which your browser interprets and displays for you. This entire process relies on various technologies working together, including DNS (Domain Name System) to translate domain names into IP addresses, HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for transferring data, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for structuring, styling, and adding interactivity to web pages.
