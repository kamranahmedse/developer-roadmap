# HTTP Explained

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It's the set of rules that govern how web browsers and web servers communicate, allowing users to request and receive resources like HTML documents, images, and other files. Essentially, it's the language that computers use to talk to each other when you browse the internet.
