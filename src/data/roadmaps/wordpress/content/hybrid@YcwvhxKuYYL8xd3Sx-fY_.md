# Hybrid Themes

Hybrid themes in WordPress combine the best aspects of traditional themes and block themes. They allow developers to use both classic PHP templates and the block editor for different parts of their website, offering flexibility in design and development. This approach enables a gradual transition to block-based theming while still leveraging existing theme structures and code.
