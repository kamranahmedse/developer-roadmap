# Shared Hosting

Shared hosting is a type of web hosting where multiple websites reside on a single physical server. Resources like CPU, memory, and bandwidth are shared among all the websites hosted on that server. This makes it a cost-effective option, especially for beginners and small websites with moderate traffic.
