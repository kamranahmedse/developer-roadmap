# Options API

The Options API provides a standardized way for plugins and themes to store, retrieve, and manage settings or configuration data in the WordPress database. It simplifies the process of creating settings pages and handling user preferences, ensuring data is stored securely and consistently. This API offers functions to add, update, retrieve, and delete options, making it easier for developers to manage plugin and theme settings without directly interacting with the database.
