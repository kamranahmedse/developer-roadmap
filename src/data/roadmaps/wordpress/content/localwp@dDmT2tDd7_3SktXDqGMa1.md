LocalWP is a free tool that simplifies the process of creating and managing local WordPress development environments on your computer. It allows you to quickly set up WordPress sites without needing to configure web servers, databases, or PHP manually. This makes it easier for developers and designers to test themes, plugins, and code changes in a safe and isolated environment before deploying them to a live server.
