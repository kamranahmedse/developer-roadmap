# Datastructures

As the name indicates itself, a **Data Structure** is a way of organizing the data in the **memory** so that it can be used efficiently. Some common data structures are array, linked list, stack, hashtable, queue, tree, heap, and graph.

- Array allocates continuous memory for homogeneous data
- Linked List stores data in nodes with references
- Stack follows Last In First Out principle
- Queue follows First In First Out principle
