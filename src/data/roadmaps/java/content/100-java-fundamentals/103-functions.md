# Functions

A method/function is a way to perform some task. Similarly, in programming like Java, a function method is a block of code written to perform a specific task repeatedly. It provides reusability of code. We write the function once and use it many times. It works on the 'DRY' principle i.e., "Do not repeat yourself".

Steps -

1. Define function - `datatype function_name(parameters){body}`
2. Call function - `function_name(values)`
3. Lambda functions - `x -> x + 1`
4. Pass a function as a variable -
```
final Consumer<Integer> simpleReference1 = App::someMethod1;  
simpleReference1.accept(1);
```
