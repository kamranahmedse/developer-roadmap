# Basics of Threads

A thread in Java is the direction or path that is taken while a program is being executed. Generally, all the programs have at least one thread, known as the main thread, that is provided by the JVM or Java Virtual Machine at the starting of the program’s execution.

Writing correct multi-threaded application is complex and it's an advanced topic. Things like ParallelStreams, thread-safe Collections and ExecutorService can be helpful.
