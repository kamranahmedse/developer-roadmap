# How JVM Works

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a platform-dependent program that executes platform-independent Java bytecode, embodying the "Write once, run everywhere" principle. As a crucial component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the JVM is responsible for initiating Java programs by calling their main method. While designed primarily for Java, the JVM's ability to run any language compiled to Java bytecode has led to its adoption by other languages like Kotlin, Scala, and Groovy. Multiple JVM implementations exist, with Oracle's HotSpot being the standard and GraalVM emerging as a high-performance alternative, each offering unique features and optimizations
