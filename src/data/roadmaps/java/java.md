  title: 'What is a Java Developer?'
  description: |
    A Java Developer is a software engineer specialized in developing applications using the Java language.

    Their work includes building web apps (like AEM or Liferay, both built in Java), desktop apps (such as Eclipse, the de facto IDE for Java itself), and enterprise systems (like ERP & CRM systems). Their responsibilities include writing code, solving technical issues, and ensuring the performance and reliability of the software.

    Java developers usually work with various tools and technologies, including JVM, frameworks like Vaadin, Struts, and others, and REST APIs, to deliver high-quality solutions.

    While Java is a very versatile language and the JVM allows for portability across multiple environments, Java developers can typically be found working in the financial, healthcare, telecom, and data-related industries.

    ## What do Java Developers do?

    Java Developers spend most of their time creating Java programs for various applications, including web apps, desktop applications, and large-scale enterprise systems. They are responsible for designing, writing, testing, and maintaining code to ensure performance, functionality, and security.

    One of the most common tasks of a Java Developer is working on backend development, where they create server-side logic, manage databases, and ensure seamless communication between different parts of an application. For example, they can use Spring Boot and Hibernate to build RESTful APIs.

    In enterprise environments, Java Developers work with large-scale solutions used by corporations, banks, and government institutions. For instance, they might develop an online banking system that processes thousands of transactions per second, ensuring high performance and reliability. In this case, they would work with JVM tuning, concurrency management, and database optimization to maintain system stability.

    Overall, Java Developers are expected to continuously learn and stay updated with the latest tech trends and best practices to ensure they deliver high-performance software solutions that meet business and user needs.

    ## What skills do I need to become a Java Developer?

    To become a Java Developer you need multiple different skills. The first thing you need is a strong foundation in the Java programming language, its ecosystem, and a proper understanding of software engineering principles.

    Of course, going deeper into Java, knowledge of JVM, concurrency, and memory management are crucial [java developer skills](https://roadmap.sh/java/developer-skills) to work on those large-scale enterprise systems.

    If you're working with RESTful APIs (which is highly likely), understanding technologies like Hibernate and having experience with Oracle (or other types of SQL) databases are important for backend Java developers.

    Generally speaking, devs should also be skilled in analyzing and solving tech problems, working within a team, and following industry standards in software development. Given the industries where Java is quite popular, familiarity with web applications, testing tools, and modern engineering practices is also very valuable.

    ## How do I become a Java Developer?

    To become a Java developer, it's highly recommended to follow a structured learning process (for example, the [Java roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/java) is a good place to start).

    The first thing to focus on is to learn the Java programming language, gaining an understanding of its core concepts, typing system, and some Object Oriented Programming (given how Java is highly based on it). You'll likely expand this last part over time, as it's one of the core principles around the language.

    Once familiar with Java, start practicing developing small Java programs; they will give you a chance to face real-world problems and find creative solutions to them. While you're doing that, try to study best practices and understand development methodologies to help you build expertise.

    And if that wasn't enough, many aspiring developers take online training courses and gain real-world experience through entry-level roles. In the end, the best way to learn programming is by doing, and these entry-level jobs are great for that.
