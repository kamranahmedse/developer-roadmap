# Configuration Files

Configuration files are critical for PHP applications because they help manage dynamic settings like database connection information, error reporting, and many other PHP settings without hard coding, making your application flexible and secure. PHP uses an "php.ini" file to hold these settings. You can modify settings by accessing and changing values in this file. For example, to adjust the maximum file upload size, you might modify the `upload_max_filesize` directive. However, changes to the `php.ini` file take effect only after the server is restarted.
