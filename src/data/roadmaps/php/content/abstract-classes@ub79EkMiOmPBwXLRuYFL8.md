# Abstract classes

Abstract classes in PHP are those which cannot be instantiated on their own. They are simply blueprints for other classes, providing a predefined structure. By declaring a class as abstract, you can define methods without having to implement them. Subsequent classes, when inheriting from an abstract class, must implement these undefined methods.
