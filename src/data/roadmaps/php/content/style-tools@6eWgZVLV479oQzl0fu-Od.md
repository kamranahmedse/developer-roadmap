# Style Tools

Style Tools in PHP are primarily coding standard tools that help maintain a consistent coding style throughout your PHP project. PHP_CodeSniffer is a popular tool in this category. It tokenizes PHP, JavaScript, and CSS files and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards. A brief example of PHP_CodeSniffer usage would be to run it in the command line like this: `phpcs /path/to/code/myfile.php`. Other tools, such as PHP CS Fixer, can automatically correct coding standard violations.
