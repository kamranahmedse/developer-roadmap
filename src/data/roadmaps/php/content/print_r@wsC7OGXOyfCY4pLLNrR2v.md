# print_r

The print_r function in PHP is used to print human-readable information about a variable, ranging from simple values to more complex, multi-dimensional arrays and objects. It's exceptionally helpful while debugging, providing more information about the variable's contents than the echo or print functions. For example, in the code `$array = array('apple', 'banana', 'cherry'); print_r($array);`, it will display Array ( [0] => apple [1] => banana [2] => cherry ). Further information about the print_r function can be found at the [PHP documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.print-r.php).
