# echo

'echo' is a language construct in PHP, and it is commonly used to output one or more strings to the browser. This command doesn't behave like a function, hence it doesn't require parentheses unless it's necessary to avoid confusion. Check out a simple example below where we are using echo to output a simple string:

```php
echo "Hello, world!";
```

This will indeed output: Hello, world!

It's also worth mentioning that 'echo' also supports multiple parameters. The PHP official documentation provides more detailed information: [PHP: echo](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.echo.php).
