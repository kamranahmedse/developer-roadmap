# PHP CodeSniffer

PHP CodeSniffer is a tool used to ensure your PHP code adheres to a defined coding standard. It works by tokenizing your code and detecting violations of a pre-configured set of rules, covering aspects like indentation, spacing, naming conventions, and more. This helps maintain code consistency across projects and teams, making it easier to read, understand, and maintain.
