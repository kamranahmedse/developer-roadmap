# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple algorithm used for classifying data points based on their proximity to other data points. Given a new, unclassified data point, KNN identifies the 'K' closest data points (neighbors) from the training dataset. The class that appears most frequently among these 'K' neighbors is then assigned as the class of the new data point.
