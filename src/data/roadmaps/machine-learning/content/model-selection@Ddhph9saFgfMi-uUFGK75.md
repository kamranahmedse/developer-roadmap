# Model Selection in Scikit-learn

Model selection is the process of choosing the best machine learning model from a set of candidate models for a given task. Scikit-learn offers a wide range of models, including linear models (like linear regression and logistic regression), tree-based models (like decision trees and random forests), support vector machines (SVMs), and neural networks, enabling you to find the most suitable model for your specific problem.
