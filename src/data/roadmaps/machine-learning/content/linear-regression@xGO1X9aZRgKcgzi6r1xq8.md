# Linear Regression

Linear regression is a simple method used to find the best straight line that describes the relationship between a dependent variable (the one you're trying to predict) and one or more independent variables (the ones you're using to make the prediction). It works by finding the line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the values predicted by the line. This line can then be used to predict the dependent variable for new values of the independent variables.
