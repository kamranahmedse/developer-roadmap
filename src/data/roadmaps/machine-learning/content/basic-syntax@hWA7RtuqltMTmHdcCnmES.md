# Basic Syntax in Python

Python's basic syntax defines the rules for writing code that the interpreter can understand and execute. This includes how to structure lines of code, use indentation to define code blocks, write comments for explanation, assign values to variables, and perform basic operations using operators. Understanding these fundamental elements is essential for writing any Python program, including those used in machine learning.
