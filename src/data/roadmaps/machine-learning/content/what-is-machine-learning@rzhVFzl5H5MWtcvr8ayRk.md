# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a field of computer science that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, machine learning algorithms identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data. This learning process allows machines to adapt to new situations and solve complex problems that are difficult or impossible to address with traditional programming techniques.
