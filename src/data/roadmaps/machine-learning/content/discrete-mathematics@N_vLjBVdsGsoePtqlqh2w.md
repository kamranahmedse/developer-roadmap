# Discrete Mathematics

Discrete mathematics deals with mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. This means it focuses on objects that have distinct, separated values, like integers, graphs, and logical statements. It provides the theoretical foundations and tools for reasoning about and modeling these discrete structures. This field is essential for computer science, as it provides the foundation for understanding algorithms, data structures, and information networks.
