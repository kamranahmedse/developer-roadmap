# Pooling

Pooling is a downsampling technique used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps. It summarizes the features present in a region of the feature map into a single value. This helps to reduce the computational cost, control overfitting, and make the network more robust to variations in the input, such as small shifts or distortions.
