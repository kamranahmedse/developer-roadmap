# Model Evaluation: Importance

Model evaluation is the process of assessing how well a machine learning model performs on a given dataset. It involves using various metrics and techniques to quantify the model's accuracy, reliability, and generalization ability. This assessment helps determine if the model is suitable for deployment and provides insights into areas where it can be improved.
