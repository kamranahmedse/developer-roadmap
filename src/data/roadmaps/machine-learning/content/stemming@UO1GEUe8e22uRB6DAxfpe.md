# Stemming

Stemming is a text normalization technique in natural language processing that reduces words to their root or base form, known as the stem. This is achieved by removing suffixes (like "-ing", "-ed", "-s") from words. The goal is to treat words with similar meanings as the same, even if they have slightly different forms, which helps to simplify text analysis and improve the efficiency of certain NLP tasks.
