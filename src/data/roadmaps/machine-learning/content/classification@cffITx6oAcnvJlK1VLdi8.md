# Classification

Classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to assign data points to predefined categories or classes. Given a set of labeled data (where each data point has a known class), the algorithm learns a mapping function that can predict the class label for new, unseen data. The output is a discrete value representing the predicted class.
