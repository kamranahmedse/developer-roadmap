# TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open-source software library created by Google for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. It provides a flexible architecture and tools that allow users to easily build and deploy machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks. TensorFlow excels at handling complex computations across various platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, making it suitable for research, development, and production environments.
