# Keras

Keras is a high-level, user-friendly neural networks API written in Python. It acts as an interface for several lower-level backends like TensorFlow, CNTK, and Theano. This allows developers to quickly prototype and build deep learning models without needing to delve into the complexities of the underlying computational frameworks. Keras focuses on enabling fast experimentation through its modularity, ease of use, and support for various neural network layers and optimizers.
