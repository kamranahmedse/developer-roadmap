# Calculus

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with continuous change. It provides tools and techniques for understanding rates of change and accumulation. The two main branches are differential calculus, which focuses on finding the rate of change of a function, and integral calculus, which focuses on finding the accumulation of quantities. These concepts are fundamental for optimization, modeling, and understanding the behavior of functions.
