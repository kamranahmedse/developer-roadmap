# Polynomial Regression

Polynomial regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm used when the relationship between the input features and the output variable is non-linear. Instead of fitting a straight line, it fits a polynomial equation to the data. This allows the model to capture curves and more complex relationships, potentially leading to better predictions when a linear model is insufficient. The degree of the polynomial determines the complexity of the curve that can be fitted.
