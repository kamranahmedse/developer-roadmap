# Convolution

Convolution is a mathematical operation that involves sliding a filter (also known as a kernel) over an input image or feature map. At each location, the filter performs element-wise multiplication with the corresponding part of the input, and then sums the results. This sum becomes a single value in the output feature map. By sliding the filter across the entire input, the convolution operation extracts features and patterns present in the image, such as edges, textures, or shapes.
