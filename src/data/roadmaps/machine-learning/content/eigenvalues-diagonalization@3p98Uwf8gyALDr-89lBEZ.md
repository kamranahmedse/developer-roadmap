# Eigenvalues and Diagonalization

Eigenvalues are special numbers associated with a square matrix that, when multiplied by a corresponding eigenvector, result in the same vector scaled by that eigenvalue. Diagonalization is the process of transforming a square matrix into a diagonal matrix, where all off-diagonal elements are zero, using its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This transformation simplifies many matrix operations and provides insights into the matrix's properties.
