# Precision

Precision measures how accurate a model's positive predictions are. It tells you, out of all the instances the model predicted as positive, what proportion were actually positive. In simpler terms, it answers the question: "When the model says something is true, how often is it actually true?". The formula for precision is: Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives).
