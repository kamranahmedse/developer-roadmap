# Chain Rule of Derivation

The chain rule is a formula for finding the derivative of a composite function. If you have a function that's made up of one function inside another (like sin(x²) ), the chain rule lets you break down the differentiation process. It states that the derivative of the composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, multiplied by the derivative of the inner function.
