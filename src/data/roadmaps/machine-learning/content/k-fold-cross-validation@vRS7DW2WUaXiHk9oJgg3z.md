# K-Fold Cross Validation

K-Fold Cross Validation is a technique used to assess how well a machine learning model will generalize to an independent dataset. It works by dividing the available data into *k* equally sized folds or subsets. The model is then trained *k* times, each time using *k-1* folds as the training set and the remaining fold as the validation set. The performance metrics from each of the *k* iterations are then averaged to provide an overall estimate of the model's performance.
