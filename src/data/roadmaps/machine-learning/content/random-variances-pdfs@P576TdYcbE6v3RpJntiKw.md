# Random Variables and Probability Density Functions

A random variable is a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon. It can be discrete (taking on a finite or countably infinite number of values) or continuous (taking on any value within a given range).

The probability density function (PDF) describes the relative likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on a given value. It's important to note that the value of the PDF at any given point is not a probability itself, but rather the area under the PDF curve over a given interval represents the probability of the random variable falling within that interval.
