# Deep Learning Architectures

Deep learning architectures are the specific arrangements of layers within a neural network that define how data is processed and transformed. These architectures consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers, where each layer performs a specific computation. Different architectures are designed to excel at different tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, or time series analysis, by employing unique connection patterns, layer types, and activation functions.
