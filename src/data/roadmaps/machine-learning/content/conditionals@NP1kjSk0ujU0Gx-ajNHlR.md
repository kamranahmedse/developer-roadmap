# Conditionals

Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. The most common conditional statements are `if`, `elif` (else if), and `else`.  An `if` statement checks a condition, and if it's true, the code block under it runs.  `elif` allows you to check additional conditions if the initial `if` condition is false.  Finally, `else` provides a block of code to execute if none of the preceding `if` or `elif` conditions are true. These statements enable programs to make decisions and respond differently to various inputs or situations.
