# Q-Learning

Q-Learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that aims to find the best action to take given the current state. It works by learning a "Q-function," which estimates the expected cumulative reward for taking a specific action in a particular state and following the optimal policy thereafter. This Q-function is iteratively updated based on the agent's experiences, allowing it to learn the optimal policy without needing a model of the environment.
