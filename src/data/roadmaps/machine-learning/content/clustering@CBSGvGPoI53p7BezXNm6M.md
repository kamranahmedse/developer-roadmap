# Clustering

Clustering is a way to automatically group similar data points together. Imagine you have a bunch of scattered objects and you want to organize them into piles based on how alike they are. Clustering algorithms do this by finding patterns in the data, grouping data points that are close to each other in some way, and separating them from data points that are further apart. The algorithm decides which data points belong to which group, without you telling it what the groups should be beforehand.
