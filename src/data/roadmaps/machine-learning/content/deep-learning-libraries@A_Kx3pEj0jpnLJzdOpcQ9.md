# Deep Learning Libraries

Deep learning relies heavily on specialized Python libraries that provide pre-built functions and tools for building and training neural networks. TensorFlow, developed by Google, is a widely used library known for its flexibility and scalability. PyTorch, created by Facebook, is another popular choice, favored for its dynamic computation graph and ease of use, especially in research. Keras acts as a high-level API that can run on top of TensorFlow or other backends, simplifying the process of building complex models. These libraries offer functionalities like automatic differentiation, GPU acceleration, and pre-trained models, making deep learning more accessible and efficient.
