# Parquet

Parquet is a columnar storage format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. Unlike row-oriented formats, Parquet stores data by columns, which allows for better compression and faster query performance when only a subset of columns are needed. This makes it particularly well-suited for big data processing and analytics, where large datasets are common and queries often target specific columns.
