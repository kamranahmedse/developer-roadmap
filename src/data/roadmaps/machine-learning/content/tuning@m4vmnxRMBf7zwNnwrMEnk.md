# Hyperparameter Optimization in Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn provides tools to find the best settings (hyperparameters) for your machine learning models. Instead of manually trying different values, you can use techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV. These methods systematically test a range of hyperparameter combinations using cross-validation to evaluate performance. The goal is to identify the hyperparameter set that yields the best model performance on your data, improving accuracy and generalization.
