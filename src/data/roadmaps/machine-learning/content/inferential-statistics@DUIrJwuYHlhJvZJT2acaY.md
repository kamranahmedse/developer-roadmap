# Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics uses sample data to make inferences or predictions about a larger population. Instead of examining the entire population, which is often impractical or impossible, we analyze a representative subset (the sample) and then use statistical methods to draw conclusions about the characteristics of the whole population. This involves estimating population parameters (like the mean or proportion) and testing hypotheses about these parameters based on the sample data.
