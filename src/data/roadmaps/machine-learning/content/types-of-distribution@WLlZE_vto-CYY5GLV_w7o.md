# Types of Distribution

A distribution describes how data is spread or arranged across its possible values. It provides a way to understand the probability of different outcomes occurring within a dataset. Different types of distributions, like normal, uniform, or binomial, each have unique characteristics that determine the likelihood of observing specific values. Understanding these distributions is essential for summarizing data, making predictions, and performing statistical inference.
