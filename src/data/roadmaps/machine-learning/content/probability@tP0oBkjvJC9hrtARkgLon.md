# Probability

Probability is a way to quantify the likelihood of an event occurring. It provides a numerical measure, ranging from 0 to 1, that represents the likelihood of a specific outcome occurring. A probability of 0 indicates impossibility, while a probability of 1 signifies certainty. It's a fundamental concept for understanding uncertainty and making predictions based on available data.
