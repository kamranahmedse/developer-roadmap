# Scikit-learn for Neural Networks

Scikit-learn is a popular Python library mainly used for traditional machine learning tasks like classification, regression, and clustering. While it's not primarily designed for deep learning, it does offer basic tools for creating simple neural networks, specifically multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). You can use `sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier` for classification problems and `sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor` for regression problems. These tools allow you to quickly build and train basic neural networks without needing a dedicated deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
