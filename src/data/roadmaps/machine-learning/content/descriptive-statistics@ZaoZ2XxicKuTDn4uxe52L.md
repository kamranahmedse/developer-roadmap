Descriptive statistics involves methods for summarizing and organizing data in a meaningful way. It focuses on describing the main features of a dataset using measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range. These techniques help to understand the central tendency, variability, and distribution of the data without making inferences beyond the specific dataset.
