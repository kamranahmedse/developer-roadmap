# Recall

Recall measures how well a model identifies all the actual positive cases. It answers the question: "Of all the actual positive instances, how many did the model correctly predict as positive?". A high recall means the model is good at minimizing false negatives. The formula for recall is: `Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)`.
