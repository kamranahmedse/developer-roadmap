# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding by developing algorithms and models that can process and analyze text and speech data. This allows machines to perform tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.
