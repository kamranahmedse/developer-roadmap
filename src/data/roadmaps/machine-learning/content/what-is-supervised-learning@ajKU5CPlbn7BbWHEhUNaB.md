# What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from a labeled dataset. This means that each data point in the dataset is paired with a corresponding correct output, or "label." The algorithm's goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs, so that when given new, unseen inputs, it can predict the correct output based on the patterns it learned from the labeled data.
