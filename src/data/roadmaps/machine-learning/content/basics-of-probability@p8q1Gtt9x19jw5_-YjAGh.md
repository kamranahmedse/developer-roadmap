# Basics of Probability

Probability is a way to quantify the likelihood of an event occurring. It provides a numerical measure, ranging from 0 to 1, representing the chance that a specific outcome will happen. A probability of 0 indicates impossibility, while a probability of 1 signifies certainty. Understanding probability involves concepts like random variables, probability distributions, and events, which are essential for making predictions and decisions under uncertainty.
