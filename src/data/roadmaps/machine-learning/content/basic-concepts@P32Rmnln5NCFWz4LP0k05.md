# Basic Statistical Concepts

Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It provides the foundation for understanding patterns and making inferences from data, which is crucial for machine learning algorithms. Here are 10 basic statistical concepts:

*   **Mean:** The average value of a dataset, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values.
*   **Median:** The middle value in a sorted dataset.
*   **Mode:** The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.
*   **Standard Deviation:** A measure of the spread or dispersion of data points around the mean.
*   **Variance:** The square of the standard deviation, representing the average squared difference from the mean.
*   **Probability:** The likelihood of an event occurring, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.
*   **Distributions:** A function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur (e.g., normal distribution, uniform distribution).
*   **Hypothesis Testing:** A method for testing a claim or hypothesis about a population based on a sample of data.
*   **Correlation:** A statistical measure that describes the extent to which two variables are related.
*   **Regression:** A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
