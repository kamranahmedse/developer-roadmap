# Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network designed to process sequential data, where the order of the inputs matters. Unlike traditional feedforward networks that treat each input independently, RNNs have a "memory" that allows them to consider previous inputs when processing new ones. This memory is implemented through recurrent connections, which feed the output of a neuron back into itself or other neurons in the network, enabling the network to learn patterns and dependencies across time or sequence steps.
