# Python Loops

Loops in Python are a way to repeat a block of code multiple times. They allow you to execute a set of instructions over and over, either a specific number of times or until a certain condition is met. Python has two main types of loops: `for` loops, which are typically used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or string), and `while` loops, which continue executing as long as a given condition remains true.
