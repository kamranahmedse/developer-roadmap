# Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' Theorem is a mathematical formula that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It essentially calculates the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. The theorem uses prior knowledge of conditions related to the event to refine the probability estimate as new information becomes available.
