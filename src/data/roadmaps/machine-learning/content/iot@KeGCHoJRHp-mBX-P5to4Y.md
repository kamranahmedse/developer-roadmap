The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and actuators that enable these objects to connect and exchange data. These devices continuously generate vast amounts of data reflecting their status, environment, and interactions. This data can include sensor readings like temperature, pressure, humidity, location, and images or video streams.
