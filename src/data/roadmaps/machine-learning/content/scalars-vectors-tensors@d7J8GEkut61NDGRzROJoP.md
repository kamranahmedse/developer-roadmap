# Scalars, Vectors, and Tensors

Scalars, vectors, and tensors are fundamental building blocks for representing data in machine learning. A scalar is a single numerical value, like a temperature reading. A vector is an ordered array of numbers, representing a point in space or a feature set for a single data instance. A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to higher dimensions; it can be thought of as a multi-dimensional array, useful for representing images, videos, or complex datasets with multiple features and relationships.
