# Lemmatization

Lemmatization is a text normalization technique in natural language processing used to reduce words to their dictionary form, known as a lemma. Unlike stemming, which simply chops off prefixes or suffixes, lemmatization considers the context of the word and applies morphological analysis to find the base or dictionary form. This ensures that the resulting lemma is a valid word, providing a more accurate and meaningful representation of the original word.
