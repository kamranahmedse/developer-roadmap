# Python Data Structures

Python provides several built-in data structures for organizing and storing data. These structures include lists, which are ordered and mutable collections; tuples, which are ordered and immutable collections; dictionaries, which store data in key-value pairs; and sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements. Each data structure offers different performance characteristics and is suitable for various tasks depending on the specific requirements of the program.
