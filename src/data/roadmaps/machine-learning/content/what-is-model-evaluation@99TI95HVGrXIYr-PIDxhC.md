# Model Evaluation

Model evaluation is the process of assessing how well a machine learning model performs on a given dataset. It involves using various metrics and techniques to quantify the model's accuracy, reliability, and generalization ability. This helps determine if the model is suitable for deployment and whether further improvements are needed.
