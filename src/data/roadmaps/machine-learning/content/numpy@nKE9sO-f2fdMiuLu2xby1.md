# NumPy

NumPy is a fundamental Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. These arrays are homogeneous, meaning they contain elements of the same data type, which allows for optimized storage and computation. NumPy is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing due to its performance and ease of use.
