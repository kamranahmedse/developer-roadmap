# Determinants and Inverse of a Matrix

A determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix and encodes certain properties of the linear transformation described by the matrix. The inverse of a matrix, denoted as A⁻¹, is another matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix A, results in the identity matrix. The inverse exists only for square matrices with a non-zero determinant, making the matrix invertible.
