# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) Applications

CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision, leading to significant advancements in many real-world applications. Thanks to their power to solve complex problems like image classification, object detection, and facial recognition, CNNs power many applications we use daily, like automatically tagging friends in photos, enabling self-driving cars to "see" and understand their surroundings, and helping doctors diagnose diseases from medical scans. They are also used to generate realistic images, translate languages, and even create art.
