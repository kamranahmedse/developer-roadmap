# Variables and Data Types

Variables are named storage locations in a computer's memory used to hold data. Data types classify the kind of value a variable can hold, such as numbers (integers, decimals), text (strings), or boolean values (true/false). Understanding variables and data types is fundamental to writing any program, as it dictates how data is stored, manipulated, and used within the code.
