# Functions and Built-in Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They take inputs, process them, and return an output. Python provides many built-in functions like `print()` for displaying output, `len()` for finding the length of a sequence, and `type()` for determining the data type of a variable. These built-in functions are readily available for use, while you can also define your own custom functions, also known as user-defined functions (UDFs), to encapsulate specific logic and improve code organization.
