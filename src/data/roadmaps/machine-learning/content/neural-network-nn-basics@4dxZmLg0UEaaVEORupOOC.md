# Neural Network (NN) Basics

A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. It consists of interconnected nodes, called neurons, organized in layers. These neurons process and transmit signals, learning complex patterns from data through adjusting the strengths of the connections (weights) between them.
