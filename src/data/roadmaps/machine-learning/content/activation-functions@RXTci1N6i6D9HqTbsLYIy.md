# Activation Functions

Activation functions in neural networks determine the output of a node given an input or set of inputs. They introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns and relationships in data. Without activation functions, a neural network would simply be a linear regression model, severely limiting its ability to model intricate data.
