# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is about creating computer programs that can learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, these programs improve their performance on a specific task as they are exposed to more data. This learning process allows them to make predictions or decisions without being directly told how to do so.
