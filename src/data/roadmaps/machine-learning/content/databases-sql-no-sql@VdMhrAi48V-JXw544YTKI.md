# Databases (SQL, No-SQL)

Databases are organized collections of data, stored and accessed electronically. SQL databases, like MySQL or PostgreSQL, use a structured, table-based format with a predefined schema, enforcing relationships between data through keys. NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB or Cassandra, offer more flexible data models like document, key-value, or graph, allowing for unstructured or semi-structured data and often prioritizing scalability and speed over strict consistency.
