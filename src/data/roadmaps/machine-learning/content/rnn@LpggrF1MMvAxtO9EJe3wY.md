# Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network designed to process sequential data. Unlike standard feedforward networks that treat each input independently, RNNs have connections that loop back on themselves, allowing them to maintain a "memory" of past inputs. This memory enables them to learn patterns and dependencies across sequences, making them suitable for tasks like natural language processing, time series analysis, and speech recognition.
