# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward. The agent interacts with the environment, takes actions, and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Through trial and error, the agent learns a policy that maps states to actions, aiming to accumulate the most reward over time.
