# Autoencoders

Autoencoders are a type of neural network used to learn efficient data representations in an unsupervised manner. They work by compressing the input data into a lower-dimensional "code" and then reconstructing the original input from this compressed representation. By forcing the network to learn a compressed version of the data, autoencoders can discover important features and reduce the dimensionality of the data, making it easier to process and analyze.
