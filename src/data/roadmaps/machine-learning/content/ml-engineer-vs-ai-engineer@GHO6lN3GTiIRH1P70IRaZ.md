# ML Engineer vs. AI Engineer

An ML Engineer primarily concentrates on building, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models in production environments. An AI Engineer, on the other hand, typically has a broader scope, encompassing the design and development of entire AI systems, which may include components beyond just machine learning, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
