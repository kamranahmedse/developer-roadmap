# Derivatives and Partial Derivatives

A derivative measures how a function changes as its input changes. Imagine a curve on a graph; the derivative at a specific point tells you the slope of the line tangent to that curve at that point. When dealing with functions of multiple variables, we use partial derivatives. A partial derivative measures how a function changes with respect to one specific variable, while holding all other variables constant.
