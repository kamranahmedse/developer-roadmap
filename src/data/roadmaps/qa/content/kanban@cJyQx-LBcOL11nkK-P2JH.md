# Kanban

Kanban is a very popular framework for development in the agile software development methodology. It provides a transparent way of visualizing the tasks and work capacity of a team. It mainly uses physical and digital boards to allow the team members to visualize the current state of the project they are working on.

A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency.
