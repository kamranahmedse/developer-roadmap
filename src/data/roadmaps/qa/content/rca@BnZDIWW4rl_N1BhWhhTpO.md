# Root Cause Analysis

Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a systematic problem-solving method that aims to identify the fundamental reasons behind an issue or event. It goes beyond addressing the immediate symptoms to uncover the core factors that led to the problem, to prevent recurrence. By understanding the underlying causes, effective solutions can be implemented to eliminate or mitigate the risk of similar issues happening again.
