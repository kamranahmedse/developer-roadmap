# Webdriver.io

WebdriverIO is a progressive automation framework built to automate modern web and mobile applications. It simplifies the interaction with your app and provides a set of plugins that help you create a scalable, robust and stable test suite.

WebdriverIO leverages the power of the WebDriver protocol that is developed and supported by all browser vendors and guarantees a true cross-browser testing experience. While other automation tools require you to download modified browser that aren't used by actual users or emulate user behavior by injecting JavaScript, WebdriverIO relies on a common agreed standard for automation that is properly tested and ensures compatibility for decades to come.

During the development of this automation standard the web has changed a lot and many of the requirements that developers have today to test their web application can not be fulfilled using WebDriver anymore. While some of the core contributors of this project help support the next generation of the WebDriver protocol, WebdriverIO provides an alternative automation solution based on the Chrome DevTools protocol. This allows the user to seamlessly switch between conventional commands based on WebDriver and powerful browser interactions through Puppeteer.
