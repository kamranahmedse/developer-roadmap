# Testing Methodologies

Testing methodologies are structured approaches to software testing, each with its own philosophy and techniques. Test-Driven Development (TDD) involves writing tests before writing the code, ensuring the code meets specific requirements. Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) focuses on defining acceptance criteria collaboratively with stakeholders, driving development from a business perspective. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) uses plain language descriptions of system behavior to create tests, promoting better communication between developers, testers, and business stakeholders. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a systematic process for identifying the underlying causes of problems or defects, aiming to prevent recurrence rather than just addressing the symptoms.
