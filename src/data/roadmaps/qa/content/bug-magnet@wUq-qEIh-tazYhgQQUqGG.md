Exploratory Testing is all about exploring the software by navigating random paths and discovering what it can do and what it can’t. In exploratory testing we try to verify how well system reacts to special/invalid inputs and edge cases. Bug Magnet will help you configure Data validations and variety input scenarios likely to cause issues.
