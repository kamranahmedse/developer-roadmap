Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs—faster. It is an API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test, and document APIs. With this open-source solution, users can create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests and read their responses.

Newman is a command-line Collection Runner for Postman. It enables you to run and test a Postman Collection directly from the command line. It's built with extensibility to integrate it with your continuous integration servers and build systems.
