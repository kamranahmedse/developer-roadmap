# Mocking

Mocking is a testing technique where you replace real dependencies (like databases, APIs, or other services) with simulated objects that mimic their behavior. This allows you to isolate the code you're testing and verify that it interacts correctly with those dependencies, without actually relying on them being available or behaving predictably.
