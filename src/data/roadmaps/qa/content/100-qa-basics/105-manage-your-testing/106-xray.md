# xRay

Xray is a complete Test Management tool for Jira. It is a full-featured app that does not require any other software in order to run.
Xray supports the entire testing life cycle:  test planning, test design, test execution and test reporting. Xray does this by using special Jira issue types, so you can use all Jira benefits that you are used to.
Jira's aim is to help you improve the quality of your systems through effective and efficient testing. That's why from its first version, Xray already supports both manual and automated tests, including full support for BDD framework (e.g. Cucumber, SpecFlow, Serenity BDD) examples/tests in the native language (i.e., English).
