# Performance Testing

Performance Testing is a subset of Performance Engineering. It is a process of evaluating a system’s behavior under various extreme conditions. The main intent of performance testing is monitoring and improving key performance indicators such as response time, throughput, memory, CPU utilization, and more.

There are three objectives (three S) of Performance testing to observe and evaluate: `Speed`, `Scalability`, and `Stability`.
