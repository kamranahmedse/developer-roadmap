# Testing Data Management

Data testing management involves the strategies and processes used to plan, create, acquire, store, control, and protect the data used for testing software applications. It ensures that testers have access to the right data, in the right format, at the right time, to effectively validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of the system under test. This includes techniques for data masking, data generation, data subsetting, and data virtualization to create realistic and representative test environments.
