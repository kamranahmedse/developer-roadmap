# Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)

ATDD is a collaborative approach where the whole team defines acceptance criteria before development begins. These acceptance criteria are then turned into automated tests, which guide the development process. The goal is to ensure that the software meets the specific needs and expectations of the stakeholders.
