# Swift Testing

Swift testing involves writing code to automatically verify the functionality of Swift applications, especially those built for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. This includes creating unit tests to check individual components, UI tests to simulate user interactions, and performance tests to ensure the app runs efficiently. The goal is to identify and fix bugs early in the development cycle, leading to more reliable and robust mobile applications.
