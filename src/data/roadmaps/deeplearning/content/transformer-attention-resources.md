# Transformer Attention

We will first focus on the Transformer attention mechanism in this tutorial and subsequently review the Transformer model in a separate one.Before the introduction of the Transformer model, the use of attention for neural machine translation was implemented by RNN-based encoder-decoder architectures. The Transformer model revolutionized the implementation of attention by dispensing with recurrence and convolutions and, alternatively, relying solely on a self-attention mechanism."The Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution".
