# Keras

Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. 
It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.
Simple - but not simplistic. Keras reduces developer cognitive load to free you to focus on the parts of the problem that really matter.Powerful -- Keras provides industry-strength performance and scalability: it is used by organizations and companies including NASA, YouTube, or Waymo.
