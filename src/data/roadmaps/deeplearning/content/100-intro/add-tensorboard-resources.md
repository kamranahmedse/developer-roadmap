# TensorBoard

TensorBoard is a web-based visualization tool that is part of the TensorFlow deep learning framework. It allows users to visualize and explore various aspects of their machine learning models, such as training and validation accuracy, loss, and other metrics. TensorBoard also provides interactive visualizations of the computational graph of the model, as well as histograms of weights and biases, and images and embeddings of high-dimensional data.
