# Denoising

In computer graphics, images can be made up of both useful information and noise. 
The latter reduces clarity. The ideal end product of denoising would be a crisp image that only preserves the useful information.
When denoising an image, it’s also important to keep visual details and components such as edges, corners, textures and other sharp structures.
