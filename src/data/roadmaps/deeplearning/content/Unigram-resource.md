# Unigram

Unigram (plural unigrams) (linguistics) An n-gram consisting of a single item from a sequence. Unigram — a probability-based model.It calculates the probability of every subword token and then drops it based on a loss function that is explained in this research paper. Based on a certain threshold of the loss value, you can then trigger the model to drop the bottom 20–30% of the subword tokens.
