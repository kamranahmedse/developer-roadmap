# DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks)

DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks) is a popular and successful network design for GAN.012 It mainly composes of convolution layers without max pooling or fully connected layers. It uses convolutional stride and transposed convolution for the downsampling and the upsampling, as seen in the network design for the generator
