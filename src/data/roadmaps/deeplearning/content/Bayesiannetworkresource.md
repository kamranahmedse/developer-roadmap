# Bayesian Network Resourse

A Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model that represents the conditional dependencies among a set of random variables.It is comprised of nodes and edges, where nodes represent the random variables and edges represent the conditional dependencies between them.The network is defined by a set of conditional probability tables that specify the probability of a node given its parent nodes.Bayesian networks can be used for various tasks such as prediction, diagnosis, and decision making.They are particularly useful in domains where uncertainty and incomplete information are present.Inference in Bayesian networks involves computing probabilities of events given evidence, which can be done efficiently using algorithms such as variable elimination and belief propagation.
