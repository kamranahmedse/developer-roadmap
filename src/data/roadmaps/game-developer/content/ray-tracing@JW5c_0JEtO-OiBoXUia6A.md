# Ray Tracing

Ray tracing is a rendering technique in computer graphics that simulates the physical behavior of light. It generates images with a high degree of visual realism, as it captures shadows, reflections, and refracts light. Ray tracing follows the path of light backwards from the camera (eye) to the source (light object), calculating the color of each pixel in the image on the way. The color value calculation considers the object from which the ray has reflected or refracted, and the nature of the light source i.e. whether it's ambient, point or spot. Ray tracing algorithm handles effects that rasterization algorithms like scanline rendering and 'Z-buffer' find complex to handle.
