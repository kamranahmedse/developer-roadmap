# Decision Making

In game development, decision making often refers to the logic or processes that determine the behavior of non-playable characters or game environments. Three main types of decision making are used: deterministic, stochastic, and strategic. Deterministic decision making is based on predefined rules. With stochastic decision making, outcomes are probability-based, providing an element of randomness. Strategic decision making involves planning a sequence of actions to achieve a specified goal. Decisions can also be guided using various API tools such as **pathfinding algorithms** (which determine the shortest path between two points) or **decision trees** (which facilitate the selection of an action based on certain conditions). The choice of decision-making method depends largely on the desired complexity and behavior of your game elements.
