# Game Physics

Game Physics is an integral part of game development that simulates the laws of physics in a virtual environment. This simulation brings realism into the game by defining how objects move, interact, and react to collisions and forces. Game physics ranges from how a character jumps or moves in a 2D or 3D space, to more complex mechanics such as fluid dynamics or ragdoll physics. Two main types of game physics are 'arcade physics', which are simpler and more abstract; and 'realistic physics', attempting to fully recreate real-life physics interactions. Implementing game physics requires a combination of mathematical knowledge and programming skills to integrate physics engines like Unity's PhysX and Unreal Engine's built-in physics tool.
