# DirectX

**DirectX** is a collection of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) developed by Microsoft to handle tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms. It was first introduced in 1995 and has become a crucial component for PC gaming. DirectX serves as an intermediary between a hardware and a software, managing the state of the hardware and giving commands to it. Some technologies under DirectX includes Direct3D for 3D graphics, DirectDraw for 2D graphics, DirectSound for sound, and DirectInput for interfacing with input devices such as keyboard and mouse.
