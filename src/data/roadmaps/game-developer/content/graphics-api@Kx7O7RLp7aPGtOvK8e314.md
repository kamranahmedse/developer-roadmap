# Graphics API

A Graphics API (Application Programming Interface) is a collection of commands, functions, protocols, and tools that game developers use to build games. It forms an interface between the game and the hardware of the device, usually a computer or console, and assists in rendering 2D and 3D graphics performance. Complex tasks such as drawing polygons, texturing, or lighting are encapsulated in a more manageable, higher-level process by the API. Common examples are Vulkan, DirectX, OpenGL, and Metal. Each one varies in availability and performance across different platforms and devices and has unique features that can be utilized for game development.
