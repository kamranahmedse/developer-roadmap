# Assembly

**Assembly** is a low-level programming language, often used for direct hardware manipulation, real-time systems, and to write performance-critical code. It provides a strong correspondence between its instructions and the architecture's machine-code instructions, since it directly represents the specific commands of the computer's CPU structure. However, it's closer to machine language (binary code) than to human language, which makes it difficult to read and understand. The syntax varies greatly, which depends upon the CPU architecture for which it's designed, thus Assembly language written for one type of processor can't be used on another. Despite its complexity, time-intensive coding process and machine-specific nature, Assembly language is still utilized for speed optimization and hardware manipulation where high-level languages may not be sufficient.
