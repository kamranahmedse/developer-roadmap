# Linear Velocity

**Linear Velocity** is a fundamental concept in physics that is extensively used in game development. It refers to the rate of change of an object's position with respect to a frame of reference. It's calculated by dividing the change in position by the change in time, often represented with the vector 'v'. In game development, an object's linear velocity can be manipulated to control its speed and direction. This is especially important in the development of physics simulations or movement-dependent gameplay elements. For instance, it can be used to make a character run or drive, or to throw an object at different speeds and directions.
