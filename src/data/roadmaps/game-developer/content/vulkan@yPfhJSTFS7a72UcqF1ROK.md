# Vulkan

Vulkan is a high-performance, cross-platform API for graphics and computation tasks published by the Khronos Group. Unlike other graphics APIs, Vulkan provides developers with direct control over the GPU and aims to take full advantage of multicore processors, enabling significant performance gains in 3D applications. It supports Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, and MacOS platforms. It's built from ground-up to ensure minimal overhead on the CPU side, providing a more balanced CPU/GPU usage, hence not limiting the game to a single core. Vulkan can be seen as the successor to OpenGL, as it offers lower-level functionality and more efficient multi-threading capabilities.
