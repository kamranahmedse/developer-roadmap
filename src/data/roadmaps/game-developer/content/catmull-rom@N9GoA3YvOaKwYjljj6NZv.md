# Catmull-Rom

The **Catmull-Rom** spline is a form of interpolation used in 2D and 3D graphics. Named after Edwin Catmull and Raphael Rom, it offers a simple way to smoothly move objects along a set of points or, in terms of graphics, to smoothly draw a curve connecting several points. It's a cubic interpolating spline, meaning it uses the cubic polynomial to compute coordinates. This makes Catmull-Rom ideal for creating smooth and natural curves in graphics and animation. It also has a feature called C1 continuity, ensuring the curve doesn't have any abrupt changes in direction. However, if not managed properly, it can create loops between points.
