# Orthogonal

Orthogonal projection, or orthographic projection, is a type of parallelogram projection in game development where the lines of projection are perpendicular to the projection plane. This creates a view that is straight-on, essentially removing any form of perspective. Unlike perspective projection where objects further from the viewer appear smaller, objects in orthogonal projection remain the same size regardless of distance. The lack of perspective in orthogonal projection can be useful for specific types of games like platformers or strategy games. It is commonly used in CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and technical drawings as well.
