# Sampling

**Sampling** in computer graphics is a method used to convert a continuous mathematical function (image, signal, light and sound), into a discrete digital representation. The process is done by taking snapshots at regular intervals which are also known as samples, and it's this that gives us the concept of 'sampling'. Some common types of sampling techniques include: uniform sampling (evenly spaced samples), random sampling (samples taken at random intervals), and jittered sampling (a compromise between uniform and random sampling). The higher the sampling rate, the more accurately the original function can be reconstructed from the discrete samples. Effective sampling is a significant aspect of achieving realistic computer graphics.
