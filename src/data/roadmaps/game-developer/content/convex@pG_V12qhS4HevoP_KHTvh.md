# Convex

The term "convex" in game development relates primarily to shapes and collision detection within the gaming environment. A shape is convex if all line segments between any two points in the shape lie entirely within the shape. This is an essential concept when programming collision detection and physics engines in games since the mathematical calculations can be more straightforward and efficient when the objects are convex. In addition to this, many rendering algorithms also operate optimally on convex objects, thereby helping improve the game’s graphical performance.
