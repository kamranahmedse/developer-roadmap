# Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is a vital field in Mathematics that is extensively used in game development. It revolves around vector spaces and the mathematical structures used therein, including matrices, determinants, vectors, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, among others. In the context of game development, linear algebra is used mainly for computer graphics, physics, AI, and many more. It allows developers to work with spatial transformations, helping them manipulate and critically interact with the 3D space of the game. On a broader context, it is important in computer programming for algorithms, parallax shifting, polygonal modeling, collision detection, etc. From object movements, positional calculations, game physics, to creating dynamism in games, linear algebra is key.
