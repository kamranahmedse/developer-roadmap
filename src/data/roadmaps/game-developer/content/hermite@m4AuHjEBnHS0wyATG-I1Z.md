# Hermite

Hermite refers to Hermite interpolation, a fundamental technique in game development for executing smooth transitions. Essentially, Hermite interpolation is an application of polynomial mathematics, with two points applied as start/end (they're usually 3D positional vectors), and the tangents at these points controlling the curve's shape. The technique's name is derived from its inventor, Charles Hermite, a French mathematician. Hermite interpolation can be useful in different aspects of game development, such as creating smooth animations, camera paths, or motion patterns. Note, however, that while Hermite interpolation offers control over the start and end points of a sequence, it might not precisely predict the curve's full behavior.
