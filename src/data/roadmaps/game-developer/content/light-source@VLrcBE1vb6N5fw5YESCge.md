# Light Source

In game development, a **light source** is a critical component that impacts the visual appeal and realism of the scene. It represents any object in the game scene that emits light, such as the sun, a lamp, or a torch. Light sources can be categorized as static or dynamic. Static light sources do not move or change throughout the game, while dynamic light sources can move and their properties can change in real-time. The properties of light sources that can be manipulated include intensity (how bright the light is), color, range (how far the light extends), direction, and type (point, directional, or spot). The lighting and shading effects are then computed based on these light source properties and how they interact with various objects in the game scene.
