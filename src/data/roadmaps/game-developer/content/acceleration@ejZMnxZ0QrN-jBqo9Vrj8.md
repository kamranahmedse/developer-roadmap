# Acceleration

**Acceleration** refers to the rate of change in velocity per unit time. This physical concept is translated into game dynamics where it impacts the movement and speed of game characters or objects. For example, when a character starts moving, there is usually a slight delay before they reach their top speed, which then continues as long as the move button is held down. This is caused by acceleration. Conversely, when the button is released, the character doesn't stop instantly but slows down gradually - this is due to deceleration, which is negative acceleration. By mastering acceleration and deceleration, game developers can create more realistic and interesting movements for their characters.
