# LLEN

`LLEN` is a Redis command used to return the length of a list stored at a specified key. If the list does not exist, it returns `0`. This command is efficient for quickly checking the number of elements in a list without retrieving its contents, making it useful for monitoring queue sizes, tracking list growth, or validating data presence in real-time applications.
