# Monitoring

Monitoring in Redis involves tracking the health, performance, and resource usage of the server to ensure optimal operation and early detection of issues. Tools and commands like `INFO` (providing statistics on memory, CPU, and clients), `MONITOR` (real-time command tracking), and `SLOWLOG` (logging slow queries) offer insights into server activity. Additionally, external tools like Redis Sentinel, Prometheus, and Grafana are often integrated for more comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and visualization. Effective monitoring helps maintain stability, optimize performance, and troubleshoot potential bottlenecks, making it crucial for managing Redis deployments at scale.
