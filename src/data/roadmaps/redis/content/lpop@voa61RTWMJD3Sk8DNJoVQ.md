# LPOP

`LPOP` is a Redis command that removes and returns the first element from the left side of a list. If the list is empty or does not exist, it returns `nil`. This command is commonly used in scenarios like implementing queues or consuming elements in FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order, making it ideal for task processing, message handling, and managing ordered data flows in real-time applications.
