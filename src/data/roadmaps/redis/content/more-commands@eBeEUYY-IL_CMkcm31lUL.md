# More Commands - Lists

Redis Lists include operations like LTRIM to trim the list to a specified range, RPOPLPUSH to remove an element from one list and append it to another, and BLPOP or BRPOP for blocking pop operations that wait until an element is available. Commands like LPOS allow finding the position of elements, and LSET is used to update a list element at a specified index. These additional commands provide robust functionality for manipulating lists, implementing queue-based patterns, and ensuring efficient handling of ordered data, making lists highly suitable for real-time data pipelines and task queues.
