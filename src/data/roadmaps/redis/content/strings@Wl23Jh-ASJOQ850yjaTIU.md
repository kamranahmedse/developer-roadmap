# Strings

Strings in Redis are binary-safe, meaning they can contain any kind of data, including text, integers, floats, or even binary data like images and they can hold up to 512 MB of data per key. Redis strings support a wide range of operations, from basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to more complex manipulations like incrementing/decrementing numeric values, appending data, or extracting substrings.
