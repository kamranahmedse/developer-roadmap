# Backup and Recovery

Backing up and recovering Redis data is crucial for ensuring data persistence and reliability. Redis, by default, stores its data in memory for fast access, but it provides mechanisms to persist data to disk to allow for recovery in case of failure or system restarts. The primary methods for backup and recovery in Redis are RDB snapshots and AOF (Append-Only File). These methods can be used individually or in combination, depending on the specific use case.
