# More Commands - Hashes

Redis Hashes include operations like HMSET and HMGET to set or retrieve multiple fields and values at once, HINCRBY and HINCRBYFLOAT to increment the value of a field by a given integer or float, and HLEN to get the number of fields in a hash. Commands like HKEYS and HVALS are used to retrieve all field names or values, respectively, while HSCAN enables incremental iteration over large hashes. These commands extend the functionality of basic hash operations, making Redis Hashes ideal for storing and manipulating structured data, such as user profiles or configuration settings, with efficient access and updates.
