# CNNs

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) form an integral part of deep learning frameworks, particularly within the realm of image processing. Data analysts with a focus on deep learning applications often turn to CNNs for their capacity to efficiently process high-dimensional data, such as images, and extract critical features relevant to the problem at hand. As a powerful tool for modeling patterns in data, CNNs are frequently employed in applications ranging from image recognition to natural language processing (NLP). Understanding CNNs, therefore, provides a robust foundation for data analysts aspiring to harness the potential of deep learning techniques.
