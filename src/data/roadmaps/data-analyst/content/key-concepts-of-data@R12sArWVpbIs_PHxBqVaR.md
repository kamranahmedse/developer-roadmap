# Introduction to Key Concepts for Data Analysts

In the realm of data analysis, understanding some key concepts is essential. Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information and support decision-making. In the broadest sense, data can be classified into various types like nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio, each with a specific role and analysis technique. Higher-dimensional data types like time-series, panel data, and multi-dimensional arrays are also critical. On the other hand, data quality and data management are key concepts to ensure clean and reliable datasets. With an understanding of these fundamental concepts, a data analyst can transform raw data into meaningful insights.
