# Skewness

Skewness is a crucial statistical concept driven by data analysis and is a significant parameter in understanding the distribution shape of a dataset. In essence, skewness provides a measure to define the extent and direction of asymmetry in data. A positive skewness indicates a distribution with an asymmetric tail extending towards more positive values, while a negative skew indicates a distribution with an asymmetric tail extending towards more negative values. For a data analyst, recognizing and analyzing skewness is essential as it can greatly influence model selection, prediction accuracy, and interpretation of results.
