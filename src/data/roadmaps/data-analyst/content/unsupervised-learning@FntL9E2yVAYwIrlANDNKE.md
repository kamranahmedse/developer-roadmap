# Unsupervised Learning in Machine Learning Basics

Unsupervised learning, as a fundamental aspect of Machine Learning, holds great implications in the realm of data analytics. It is an approach where a model learns to identify patterns and relationships within a dataset that isn't labelled or classified. It is especially useful for a Data Analyst as it can assist in recognizing unforeseen trends, providing new insights or preparing data for other machine learning tasks. This ability to infer without direct supervision allows a vast potential for latent structure discovery and new knowledge derivation from raw data.
