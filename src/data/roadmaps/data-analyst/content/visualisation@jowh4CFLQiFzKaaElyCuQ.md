The visualization of data is an essential skill in the toolkit of every data analyst. This practice is about transforming complex raw data into a graphical format that allows for an easier understanding of large data sets, trends, outliers, and important patterns.

This key concept underscores the importance of presenting data in a digestible and visually appealing manner to drive data-informed decision making in an organization.
