# Data Visualization

Data Visualization is a fundamental fragment of the responsibilities of a data analyst. It involves the presentation of data in a graphical or pictorial format which allows decision-makers to see analytics visually. This practice can help them comprehend difficult concepts or establish new patterns. With interactive visualization, data analysts can take the data analysis process to a whole new level — drill down into charts and graphs for more detail, and interactively changing what data is presented or how it’s processed. Thereby it forms a crucial link in the chain of converting raw data to actionable insights which is one of the primary roles of a Data Analyst.
