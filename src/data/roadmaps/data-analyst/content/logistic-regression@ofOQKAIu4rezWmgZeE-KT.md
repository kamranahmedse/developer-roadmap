# Logistic

Logistic Regression is one of the foundational techniques that a data analyst must understand in machine learning. This method is a predictive analysis algorithm based on the concept of probability. Itâ€™s used for categorizing data into distinct classes, making it particularly useful for binary classification problems. It should be understood that despite its name, logistic regression is used in classification problems, not regression tasks. Data analysts use this algorithm to build machine learning models to solve various real-world problems such as email spam, credibility of loan applicants, development of marketing strategies and so on.
