# Hypothesis Testing

In the context of a Data Analyst, hypothesis testing plays an essential role to make inferences or predictions based on data. Hypothesis testing is an approach used to test a claim or theory about a parameter in a population, using data measured in a sample. This method allows Data Analysts to determine whether the observed data deviates significantly from the status quo or not. Essentially, it provides a probability-based mechanism to quantify and deal with the uncertainty inherent in conclusions drawn from not completely reliable data.
