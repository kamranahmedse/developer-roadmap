# Data Collection

In the realm of data analysis, the concept of collection holds immense importance. As the term suggests, collection refers to the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables in an established systematic fashion that enables a data analyst to answer relevant questions and evaluate outcomes. This step is foundational to any data analysis scheme, as it is the first line of interaction with the raw data that later transforms into viable insights. The effectiveness of data analysis is heavily reliant on the quality and quantity of data collected. Different methodologies and tools are employed for data collection depending on the nature of the data needed, such as surveys, observations, experiments, or scraping online data stores. This process should be carried out with clear objectives and careful consideration to ensure accuracy and relevance in the later stages of analysis and decision-making.
