# DATEDIF

The `DATEDIF` function is an incredibly valuable tool for a Data Analyst in Excel or Google Sheets, by providing the ability to calculate the difference between two dates. This function takes in three parameters: start date, end date and the type of difference required (measured in years, months, days, etc.). In Data Analysis, particularly when dealing with time-series data or when you need to uncover trends over specific periods, the `DATEDIF` function is a necessary asset. Recognizing its functionality will enable a data analyst to manipulate or shape data progressively and efficiently.

`DATEDIF` is technically still supported, but wont show as an option. For additional information, see Excel "Help" page.
