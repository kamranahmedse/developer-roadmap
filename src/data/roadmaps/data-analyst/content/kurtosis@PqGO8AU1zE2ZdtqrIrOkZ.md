# Kurtosis 

Understanding distribution shapes is an integral part of a Data Analyst's daily responsibilities. When they inspect statistical data, one key feature they consider is the kurtosis of the distribution. In statistics, kurtosis identifies the heaviness of the distribution tails and the sharpness of the peak. A proper understanding of kurtosis can assist Analysts in risk management, outlier detection, and provides deeper insight into variations. Therefore, being proficient in interpreting kurtosis measurements of a distribution shape is a significant skill that every data analyst should master.
