# Concatenation

The term 'Concat' or ‘Concatenation’ refers to the operation of combining two or more data structures, be it strings, arrays, or datasets, end-to-end in a sequence. In the context of data analysis, a Data Analyst uses concatenation as a basic function to merge or bind data sets along an axis - either vertically or horizontally. This function is commonly used in data wrangling or preprocessing to combine data from multiple sources, handle missing values, and shape data into a form that fits better with analysis tools. An understanding of 'Concat' plays a crucial role in managing the complex, large data sets that data analysts often work with.
