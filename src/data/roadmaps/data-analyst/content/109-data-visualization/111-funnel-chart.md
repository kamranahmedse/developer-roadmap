# Funnel Chart in Data Visualization

A funnel chart is an important tool for Data Analysts. It is a part of data visualization, the creation and study of the visual representation of data. A funnel chart displays values as progressively diminishing amounts, allowing data analysts to understand the stages that contribute to the output of a process or system. It is often used in sales, marketing or any field that involves a multi-step process, to evaluate efficiency or identify potential problem areas. The 'funnel' shape is symbolic of a typical customer conversion process, going from initial engagement to close of sale. As Data Analysts, understanding and interpreting funnel charts can provide significant insights to drive optimal decision making.
