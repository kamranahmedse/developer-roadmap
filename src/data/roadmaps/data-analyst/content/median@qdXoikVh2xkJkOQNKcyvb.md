# Median

Median signifies the middle value in a data set when arranged in ascending or descending order. As a data analyst, understanding, calculating, and interpreting the median is crucial. It is especially helpful when dealing with outliers in a dataset as the median is less sensitive to extreme values. Thus, providing a more realistic 'central' value for skewed distributions. This measure is a reliable reflection of the dataset and is widely used in fields like real estate, economics, and finance for data interpretation and decision-making.
