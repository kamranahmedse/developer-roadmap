# Average

When focusing on data analysis, understanding key statistical concepts is crucial. Amongst these, central tendency is a foundational element. Central Tendency refers to the measure that determines the center of a distribution. The average is a commonly used statistical tool by which data analysts discern trends and patterns. As one of the most recognized forms of central tendency, figuring out the "average" involves summing all values in a data set and dividing by the number of values. This provides analysts with a 'typical' value, around which the remaining data tends to cluster, facilitating better decision-making based on existing data.
