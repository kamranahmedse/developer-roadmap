# Finding Outliers 

In the field of data analysis, data cleaning is an essential and preliminary step. This process involves correcting or removing any errors, inaccuracy, or irrelevance present in the obtained raw data, making it more suitable for analysis. One crucial aspect of this process is "finding outliers". Outliers are unusual or surprising data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the data. While they may be the result of mere variability or error, they will often pull the aggregate data towards them, skewing the results and impeding the accuracy of data analysis. Therefore, identifying and appropriately handling these outliers is crucial to ensure the reliability of subsequent data analysis tasks.
