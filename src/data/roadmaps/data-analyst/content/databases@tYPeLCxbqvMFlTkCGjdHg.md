# Databases

Behind every strong data analyst, there's not just a rich assortment of data, but a set of robust databases that enable effective data collection. Databases are a fundamental aspect of data collection in a world where the capability to manage, organize, and evaluate large volumes of data is critical. As a data analyst, the understanding and use of databases is instrumental in capturing the necessary data for conducting qualitative and quantitative analysis, forecasting trends and making data-driven decisions. Thorough knowledge of databases, therefore, can be considered a key component of a data analyst's arsenal. These databases can vary from relational databases like SQL to NoSQL databases like MongoDB, each serving a unique role in the data collection process.
