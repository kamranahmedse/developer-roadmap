# Kmeans

Kmeans is a fundamentally important method in data analysis and falls under the broad umbrella of machine learning basics. A data analyst using Kmeans clusters large data sets into subgroups or clusters based upon specific characteristics or parameters. The primary purpose is to derive insights from similarities/dissimilarities within the dataset, which can then be used for understanding patterns, trends, and predictive modeling. Accurate use of Kmeans can lead to enhanced decision-making, forecasting and strategic planning based on the data.
