# Mean 

Central tendency refers to the statistical measure that identifies a single value as representative of an entire distribution. The mean or average is one of the most popular and widely used measures of central tendency. For a data analyst, calculating the mean is a routine task. This single value provides an analyst with a quick snapshot of the data and could be useful for further data manipulation or statistical analysis. Mean is particularly helpful in predicting trends and patterns within voluminous data sets or adjusting influencing factors that may distort the 'true' representation of the data. It is the arithmetic average of a range of values or quantities, computed as the total sum of all the values divided by the total number of values.
