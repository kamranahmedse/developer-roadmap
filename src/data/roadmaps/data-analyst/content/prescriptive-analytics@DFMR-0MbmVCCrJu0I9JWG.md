# Prescriptive Analytics

Prescriptive analytics, a crucial type of data analytics, is essential for making data-driven decisions in business and organizational contexts. As a data analyst, the goal of prescriptive analytics is to recommend various actions using predictions on the basis of known parameters to help decision makers understand likely outcomes. Prescriptive analytics employs a blend of techniques and tools such as algorithms, machine learning, computational modelling procedures, and decision-tree structures to enable automated decision making. Therefore, prescriptive analytics not only anticipates what will happen and when it will happen, but also explains why it will happen, contributing to the significance of a data analystâ€™s role in an organization.
