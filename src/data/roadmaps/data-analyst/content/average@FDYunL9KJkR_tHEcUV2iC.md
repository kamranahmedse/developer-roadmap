For a data analyst, understanding how to calculate and interpret averages is fundamental. Basic functions, including the average, are integral components in data analysis that are used to summarize and understand complex data sets. Though conceptually simple, the power of average lies in its utility in a range of analyses - from forecasting models to understanding trends and patterns in the dataset.
