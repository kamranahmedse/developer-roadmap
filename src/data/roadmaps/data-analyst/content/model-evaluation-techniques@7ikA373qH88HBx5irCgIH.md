# Model Evaluation Techniques 

As a data analyst, it's crucial to understand various model evaluation techniques. These techniques involve different methods to measure the performance or accuracy of machine learning models. For instance, using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) among others. Knowing how to apply these techniques effectively not only helps in selecting the best model for a specific problem but also guides in tuning the performance of the models for optimal results. Understanding these model evaluation techniques also allows data analysts to interpret evaluation results and determine the effectiveness and applicability of a model.
