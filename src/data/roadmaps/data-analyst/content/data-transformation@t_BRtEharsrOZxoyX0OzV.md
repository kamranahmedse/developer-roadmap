# Data Transformation

Data Transformation, also known as Data Wrangling, is an essential part of a Data Analyst's role. This process involves the conversion of data from a raw format into another format to make it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics. Data Analysts transform data to make the data more suitable for analysis, ensure accuracy, and to improve data quality. The right transformation techniques can give the data a structure, multiply its value, and enhance the accuracy of the analytics performed by serving meaningful results.
