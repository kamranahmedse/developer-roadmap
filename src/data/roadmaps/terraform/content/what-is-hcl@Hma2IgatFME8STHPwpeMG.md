# What is HCL?

HCL, or HashiCorp Configuration Language, is a human-readable language for DevOps tools. It is used to code infrastructure management and service orchestration in a clear and manageable way. Several HashiCorp products, including Terraform, use HCL as their primary configuration language. Terraform uses HCL to provision and manage cloud resources efficiently. Its clear syntax and structure are instrumental in creating resource modules and configurations that align with the Terraform Roadmap's goals for providing a seamless, user-friendly platform for infrastructure as code.
