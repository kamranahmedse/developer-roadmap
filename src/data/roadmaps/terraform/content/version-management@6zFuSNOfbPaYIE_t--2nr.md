# Version Management

Version management in Terraform is crucial for maintaining consistency across different environments and team members. Tools like `tfenv` or `tenv` allow developers to easily switch between different versions of Terraform.

`tenv`, `tfenv`, `tfswitch` and others are version managers that install and manages multiple Terraform versions on a single system. They allow teams to specify and use specific Terraform versions for different projects, ensuring compatibility and reproducibility.  Also they help to manage potential conflicts arising from version differences, facilitates easier upgrades, and supports working on multiple projects with varying Terraform version requirements.

`tfenv` is the oldest shell-based tool that supports only Terraform. `tfswitch` supports both Terraform and OpenTofu. `tenv` supports Terraform, OpenTofu, Terragrunt, Atmos and Terramate.
