# Storage / Volumes

In AWS, an `Amazon EBS` (Elastic Block Store) is the storage volume used by EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances. It is designed for data durability, and Amazon EBS volumes automatically replicate within their Availability Zone to prevent data loss due to failure of any individual component. EBS volumes are attached to an EC2 instance, and appear as a network drive that you can mount and format using the file system of your choice. You can use Amazon EBS as the primary storage for data that requires frequent updates, such as a system drive for an instance or storage for a database application.
