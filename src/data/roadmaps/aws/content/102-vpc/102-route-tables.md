# Route Tables

A _Route Table_ in AWS VPC is a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed. Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table, which controls the traffic for the subnet. By default, your VPC has a main route table that you can modify. You can also create additional custom route tables for your VPC. A subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time, but you can change the association.
