# Route53

AWS Route 53 is a scalable and highly available domain name system (DNS) service designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route users to Internet applications. This DNS service effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in Amazon Web Services (AWS) – such as an Amazon EC2 instance, an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer, or an Amazon S3 bucket – and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS. Route 53 conceals the complexities of the underlying DNS protocol, offering developers an easy-to-use and cost-effective domain registration service. It features domain transfer capabilities, DNS failover, health checks, and customizable TTLs.
