General Purpose Storage in AWS refers to Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes designed for a broad range of workloads, including small to medium-sized databases, development and test environments, and boot volumes. The General Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes offer cost-effective storage that is ideal for a broad range of transactional workloads and delivers consistent baseline performance of 3 IOPS/GB to a maximum of 16000 IOPS. Moreover, General Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes also provide the ability to burst to higher levels of performance when needed.
