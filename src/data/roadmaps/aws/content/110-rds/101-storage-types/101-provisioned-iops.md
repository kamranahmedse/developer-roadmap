# Provisioned IOPS

"Provisioned IOPS" is a storage option available in Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Elastic Block Store (EBS). This option is designed to deliver fast, predictable, and consistent I/O performance. It allows you to specify an IOPS rate when creating a volume, and AWS will provision that rate of performance, hence the name. It's primarily suitable for databases and workloads that require high IOPS. An EBS volume with provisioned IOPS is backed by solid-state drives (SSDs), and you can specify up to a maximum of 64,000 IOPS per volume.
