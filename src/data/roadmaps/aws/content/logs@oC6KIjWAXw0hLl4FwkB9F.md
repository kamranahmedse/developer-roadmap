# Logs

AWS CloudWatch Logs service allows you to monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, AWS CloudTrail, and other sources. It centralizes the logs from all your systems, applications, and AWS services that you use, into a single, highly scalable service. You can then easily view them, search through them, set alarms, and correlate them to other operational data. It also integrates with AWS Lambda, providing the ability to respond quickly to critical operational events.
