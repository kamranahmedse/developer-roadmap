# Lambda Edge

Lambda Edge is a feature of AWS Lambda that allows you to run coding functions at AWS edge locations, closest to your customers. This can result in lower latency response times and better customer experiences. It allows you to customize the content that CloudFront delivers, executing the code after the CloudFront response or request. Lambda@Edge scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.
