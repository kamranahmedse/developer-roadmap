# EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. EC2 enables you to scale your compute capacity, develop and deploy applications faster, and run applications on AWS's reliable computing environment. You have the control of your computing resources and can access various configurations of CPU, Memory, Storage, and Networking capacity for your instances.
