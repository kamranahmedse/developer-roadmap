# Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the computing resources required by that code. It lets us run applications and services without thinking about servers. You can execute your back-end application code, run code in response to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway, or call your functions using API calls made using AWS SDKs. AWS Lambda automatically scales your applications in response to incoming requests. AWS Lambda supports Java, Go, PowerShell, Node.js, C#, Python, and Ruby code, and provides a Runtime API which allows you to use any additional programming languages to author your functions.
