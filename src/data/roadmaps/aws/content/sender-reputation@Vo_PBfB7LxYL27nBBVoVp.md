# Sender Reputation

Sender reputation in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Email Service (SES) is essentially a measure of your sending practices and how they align with the expectations of ISPs and email recipients. This reputation is determined by factors such as your email bounce rate, complaints, content quality, email volume, consistency of email sending, etc. Maintaining a good sender reputation is crucial as it impacts your email deliverability rate - i.e., whether your emails land in recipients' inbox or spam folder. AWS SES encourages good sending practices to help sustain a positive sender reputation.
