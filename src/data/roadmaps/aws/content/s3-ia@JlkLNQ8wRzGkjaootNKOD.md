Amazon S3 Infrequent Access (S3 IA) is a storage class in Amazon S3 designed for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. S3 IA offers the high durability, high throughput, and low latency of Amazon S3 Standard, with a lower cost per GB for storage and a per GB retrieval fee. This makes S3 IA suitable for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files.
