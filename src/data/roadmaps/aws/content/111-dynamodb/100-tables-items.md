# Tables / Items / Attributes

In Amazon DynamoDB, tables are a collection of items. An item is a group of attributes that is identified by a primary key. Items are similar to rows or records in other database systems. Each item in a table is uniquely identifiable by a primary key. This key can be simple (partition key only) or composite (partition key and sort key). Every attribute in an item is a name-value pair. The name of the attribute is a string and the value of an attribute can be of the following types: String, Number, Binary, Boolean, Null, List, Map, String Set, Number Set, and Binary Set.
