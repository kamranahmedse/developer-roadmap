# Dedicated IP

"Dedicated IP" in AWS SES (Simple Email Service) refers to a unique IP address that can be used exclusively by a single AWS SES customer for sending emails. When you choose to use a dedicated IP, you get full control over the reputation of that IP address, which is beneficial when sending large volume of emails. AWS can also pool multiple dedicated IPs enabling high volume senders to spread their sending across multiple IPs to maintain their reputation. It is particularly useful for companies that must comply with strict email policies or send significantly large volumes of email.
