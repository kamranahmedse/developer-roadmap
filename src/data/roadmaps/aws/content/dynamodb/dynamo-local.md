# DynamoDB Local

DynamoDB Local is a downloadable version of Amazon DynamoDB that lets you write and test applications without accessing the real AWS services. It mimics the actual DynamoDB service. You can write code while sitting in a place where internet isn't available as you don't need internet connectivity to use DynamoDB Local. It supports the same API as DynamoDB and works with your existing DynamoDB API calls. The data is stored locally in your system, not on a network, and persists between restarts of DynamoDB Local.
