# Keypairs

Key pairs are part of Amazon EC2 and are used to securely log into your instances. A key pair consists of a public key and a private key. Amazon EC2 generates the key pair and gives you the private key, whereas the public key is stored with AWS. When you launch an EC2 instance, you specify the name of the key pair. You can then use the private key to securely connect to your instance. Key pairs are region-specific, meaning you need to create separate key pairs for each region in which you operate your instances.
