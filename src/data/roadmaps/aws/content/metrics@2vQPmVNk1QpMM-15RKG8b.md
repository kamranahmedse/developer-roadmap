# Metrics

In Amazon CloudWatch, **metrics** are fundamental concepts that you work with. A metric is the fundamental concept in CloudWatch and represents a time-ordered set of data points that are published to CloudWatch. Think of a metric as a variable to monitor, and the data points as representing the values of that variable over time. Metrics are uniquely defined by a name, a namespace, and zero or more dimensions up to 30 dimensions per metric. Every data point must have a timestamp. You can retrieve statistics about those data points as an ordered set of time-series data. CloudWatch provides metrics for every service in AWS.
