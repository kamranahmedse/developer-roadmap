# Audio Processing

Audio processing in multimodal AI enables a wide range of use cases by combining sound with other data types, such as text, images, or video, to create more context-aware systems. Use cases include speech recognition paired with real-time transcription and visual analysis in meetings or video conferencing tools, voice-controlled virtual assistants that can interpret commands in conjunction with on-screen visuals, and multimedia content analysis where audio and visual elements are analyzed together for tasks like content moderation or video indexing.
