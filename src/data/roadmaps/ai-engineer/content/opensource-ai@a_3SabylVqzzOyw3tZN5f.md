# OpenSource AI

Open-source AI refers to AI models, tools, and frameworks that are freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. Examples include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and models like BERT and Stable Diffusion. Open-source AI fosters transparency, collaboration, and innovation by allowing developers to inspect code, adapt models for specific needs, and contribute improvements. This approach accelerates the development of AI technologies, enabling faster experimentation and reducing dependency on proprietary solutions.
