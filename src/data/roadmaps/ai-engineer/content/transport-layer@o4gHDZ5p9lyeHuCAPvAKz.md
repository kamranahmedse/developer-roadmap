# Transport Layer in Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Transport Layer in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is responsible for reliably and efficiently moving data between different components of an AI agent system. It defines how messages are packaged, addressed, and transmitted across a network or within a single machine, ensuring that information reaches its intended destination without errors or loss. This layer handles the underlying communication mechanisms, abstracting away the complexities of network protocols and hardware.
