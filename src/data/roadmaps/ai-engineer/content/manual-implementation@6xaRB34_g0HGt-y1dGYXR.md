# Manual Implementation

Manual intervention refers to the process where human input is needed to guide, correct, or supervise the actions of the AI. This can include tasks like fine-tuning model outputs, handling exceptions the AI can't address, or setting rules to ensure safe and reliable behavior. Manual intervention is essential when building AI agents to maintain control over critical decisions, address edge cases, and ensure ethical and accurate performance, especially in complex or sensitive applications where full autonomy is not yet feasible or advisable.
