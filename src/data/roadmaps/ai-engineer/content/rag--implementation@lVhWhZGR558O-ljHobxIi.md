# RAG & Implementation

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with language generation to produce more accurate, context-aware responses. It uses two components: a retriever, which searches a database to find relevant information, and a generator, which crafts a response based on the retrieved data. Implementing RAG involves using a retrieval model (e.g., embeddings and vector search) alongside a generative language model (like GPT). The process starts by converting a query into embeddings, retrieving relevant documents from a vector database, and feeding them to the language model, which then generates a coherent, informed response. This approach grounds outputs in real-world data, resulting in more reliable and detailed answers.
