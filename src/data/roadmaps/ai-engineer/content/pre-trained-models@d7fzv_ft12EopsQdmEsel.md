# Pre-trained Models

Pre-trained models are Machine Learning (ML) models that have been previously trained on a large dataset to solve a specific task or set of tasks. These models learn patterns, features, and representations from the training data, which can then be fine-tuned or adapted for other related tasks. Pre-training provides a good starting point, reducing the amount of data and computation required to train a new model from scratch.
