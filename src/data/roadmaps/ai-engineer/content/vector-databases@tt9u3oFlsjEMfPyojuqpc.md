# Vector Databases

Vector databases are systems specialized in storing, indexing, and retrieving high-dimensional vectors, often used as embeddings for data like text, images, or audio. Unlike traditional databases, they excel at managing unstructured data by enabling fast similarity searches, where vectors are compared to find the closest matches. This makes them essential for tasks like semantic search, recommendation systems, and content discovery. Using techniques like approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, vector databases handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring quick and accurate retrieval even at scale.
