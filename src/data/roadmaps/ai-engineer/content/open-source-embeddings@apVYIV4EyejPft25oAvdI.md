# Open-Source Embeddings

Open-source embeddings are pre-trained vector representations of data, usually text, that are freely available for use and modification. These embeddings capture semantic meanings, making them useful for tasks like semantic search, text classification, and clustering. Examples include Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, which represent words as vectors based on their context in large corpora, and more advanced models like Sentence-BERT and CLIP that provide embeddings for sentences and images. Open-source embeddings allow developers to leverage pre-trained models without starting from scratch, enabling faster development and experimentation in natural language processing and other AI applications.
