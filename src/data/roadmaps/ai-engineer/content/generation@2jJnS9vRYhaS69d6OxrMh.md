# Generation

Generation refers to the process where a generative language model, such as GPT, creates a response based on the information retrieved during the retrieval phase. After relevant documents or data snippets are identified using embeddings, they are passed to the generative model, which uses this information to produce coherent, context-aware, and informative responses. The retrieved content helps the model stay grounded and factual, enhancing its ability to answer questions, provide summaries, or engage in dialogue by combining retrieved knowledge with its natural language generation capabilities. This synergy between retrieval and generation makes RAG systems effective for tasks that require detailed, accurate, and contextually relevant outputs.
