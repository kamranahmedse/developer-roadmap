# AI Agents

In AI engineering, "agents" refer to autonomous systems or components that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Agents often interact with external systems, users, or other agents to carry out complex tasks. They can vary in complexity, from simple rule-based bots to sophisticated AI-powered agents that leverage machine learning models, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
