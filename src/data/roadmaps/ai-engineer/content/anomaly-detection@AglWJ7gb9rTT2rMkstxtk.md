# Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection with embeddings works by transforming data, such as text, images, or time-series data, into vector representations that capture their patterns and relationships. In this high-dimensional space, similar data points are positioned close together, while anomalies stand out as those that deviate significantly from the typical distribution. This approach is highly effective for detecting outliers in tasks like fraud detection, network security, and quality control.
