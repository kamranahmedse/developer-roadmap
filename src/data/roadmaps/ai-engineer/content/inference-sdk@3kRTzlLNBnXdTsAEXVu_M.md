# Inference SDK

The Hugging Face Inference SDK is a powerful tool that allows developers to easily integrate and run inference on large language models hosted on the Hugging Face Hub. By using the `InferenceClient`, users can make API calls to various models for tasks such as text generation, image creation, and more. The SDK supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations thus compatible with existing workflows.
