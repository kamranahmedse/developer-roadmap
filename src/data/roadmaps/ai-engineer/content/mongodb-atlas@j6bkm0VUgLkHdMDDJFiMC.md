# MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB Atlas, traditionally known for its document database capabilities, now includes vector search functionality, making it a strong option as a vector database. This feature allows developers to store and query high-dimensional vector data alongside regular document data. With Atlas’s vector search, users can perform similarity searches on embeddings of text, images, or other complex data, making it ideal for AI and machine learning applications like recommendation systems, image similarity search, and natural language processing tasks. The seamless integration of vector search within the MongoDB ecosystem allows developers to leverage familiar tools and interfaces while benefiting from advanced vector-based operations for sophisticated data analysis and retrieval.
