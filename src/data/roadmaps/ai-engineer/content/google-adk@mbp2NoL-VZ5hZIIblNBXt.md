The Google AI Agent Definition Kit (ADK) provides tools and frameworks for defining, building, and deploying AI agents. It helps streamline the agent development process by offering structure for agent design, tools for interacting with external APIs and data sources, and infrastructure for deploying agents in various environments. In essence, the ADK simplifies how developers create agents that can perform tasks, interact with users, and integrate with other systems.
