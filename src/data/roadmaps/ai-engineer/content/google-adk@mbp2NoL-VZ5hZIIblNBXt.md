# Google ADK

The Google AI Development Kit (ADK) provides tools and infrastructure for building AI agents. It helps developers create agents that can perceive their environment, reason about it, and take actions to achieve specific goals. The ADK typically includes libraries, APIs, and example code to streamline the development process, allowing engineers to focus on the agent's logic and behavior rather than the underlying infrastructure.
