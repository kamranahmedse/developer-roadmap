# OpenAI Response API

The OpenAI Response API provides a unified, flexible interface for generating model outputs across text, vision, audio, and tool-augmented workflows. It replaces and generalizes earlier completion-style APIs by allowing developers to send structured input and receive rich, multi-part responses, including model reasoning, tool calls, and streamed outputs.

This API is designed for building agents and applications that need conversational state, multimodal inputs, structured outputs, and tight integration with tools such as function calling, retrieval, and external services.
