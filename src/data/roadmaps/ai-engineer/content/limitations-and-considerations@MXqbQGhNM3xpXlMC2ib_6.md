# Limitations and Considerations

Pre-trained models, while powerful, come with several limitations and considerations. They may carry biases present in the training data, leading to unintended or discriminatory outcomes, these models are also typically trained on general data, so they might not perform well on niche or domain-specific tasks without further fine-tuning. Another concern is the "black-box" nature of many pre-trained models, which can make their decision-making processes hard to interpret and explain.
