# Multimodal AI

Multimodal AI is an approach that combines and processes data from multiple sources, such as text, images, audio, and video, to understand and generate responses. By integrating different data types, it enables more comprehensive and accurate AI systems, allowing for tasks like visual question answering, interactive virtual assistants, and enhanced content understanding. This capability helps create richer, more context-aware applications that can analyze and respond to complex, real-world scenarios.
