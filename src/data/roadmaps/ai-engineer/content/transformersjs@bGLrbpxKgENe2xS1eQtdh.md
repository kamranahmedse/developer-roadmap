# Transformers.js

Transformers.js is a JavaScript library that enables transformer models, like those from Hugging Face, to run directly in the browser or Node.js, without needing cloud services. It supports tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, and translation within web apps or server-side scripts. Using WebAssembly (Wasm) and efficient JavaScript, Transformers.js offers powerful NLP capabilities with low latency, enhanced privacy, and offline functionality, making it ideal for real-time, interactive applications where local processing is essential for performance and security.
