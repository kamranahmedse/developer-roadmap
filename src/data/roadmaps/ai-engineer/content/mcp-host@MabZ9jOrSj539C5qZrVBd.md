# MCP Host

The MCP Host is a central component within the Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework, responsible for managing and coordinating interactions between AI agents and the environment. It acts as a bridge, providing a standardized interface for agents to access and utilize contextual information, tools, and resources. The host handles requests from agents, ensures proper authorization and security, and facilitates communication with external systems or data sources.
