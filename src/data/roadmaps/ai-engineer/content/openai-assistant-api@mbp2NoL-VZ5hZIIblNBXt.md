# OpenAI Assistant API

The OpenAI Assistant API enables developers to create advanced conversational systems using models like GPT-4. It supports multi-turn conversations, allowing the AI to maintain context across exchanges, which is ideal for chatbots, virtual assistants, and interactive applications. Developers can customize interactions by defining roles, such as system, user, and assistant, to guide the assistant's behavior. With features like temperature control, token limits, and stop sequences, the API offers flexibility to ensure responses are relevant, safe, and tailored to specific use cases.
