# Cut-off Dates / Knowledge

OpenAI models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, have a knowledge cutoff date, which refers to the last point in time when the model was trained on data. For instance, as of the current version of GPT-4, the knowledge cutoff is October 2023. This means the model does not have awareness or knowledge of events, advancements, or data that occurred after that date. Consequently, the model may lack information on more recent developments, research, or real-time events unless explicitly updated in future versions. This limitation is important to consider when using the models for time-sensitive tasks or inquiries involving recent knowledge.
