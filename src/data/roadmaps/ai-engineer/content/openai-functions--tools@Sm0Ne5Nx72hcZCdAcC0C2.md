# OpenAI Functions / Tools

OpenAI Functions, also known as tools, enable developers to extend the capabilities of language models by integrating external APIs and functionalities, allowing the models to perform specific actions, fetch real-time data, or interact with other software systems. This feature enhances the model's utility by bridging it with services like web searches, databases, and custom business applications, enabling more dynamic and task-oriented responses.
