# Whisper API

The Whisper API by OpenAI enables developers to integrate speech-to-text capabilities into their applications. It uses OpenAI's Whisper model, a powerful speech recognition system, to convert spoken language into accurate, readable text. The API supports multiple languages and can handle various accents, making it ideal for tasks like transcription, voice commands, and automated captions. With the ability to process audio in real time or from pre-recorded files, the Whisper API simplifies adding robust speech recognition features to applications, enhancing accessibility and enabling new interactive experiences.
