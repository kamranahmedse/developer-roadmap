# Vector Databases

Vector databases are specialized systems designed to store, index, and retrieve high-dimensional vectors, often used as embeddings that represent data like text, images, or audio. Unlike traditional databases that handle structured data, vector databases excel at managing unstructured data by enabling fast similarity searches, where vectors are compared to find those that are most similar to a query. This makes them essential for tasks like semantic search, recommendation systems, and content discovery, where understanding relationships between items is crucial. Vector databases use indexing techniques such as approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to efficiently handle large datasets, ensuring quick and accurate retrieval even at scale.
