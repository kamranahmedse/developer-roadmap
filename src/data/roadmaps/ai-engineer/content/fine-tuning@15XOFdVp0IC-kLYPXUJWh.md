# Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning the OpenAI API involves adapting pre-trained models, such as GPT, to specific use cases by training them on custom datasets. This process allows you to refine the model's behavior and improve its performance on specialized tasks, like generating domain-specific text or following particular patterns. By providing labeled examples of the desired input-output pairs, you guide the model to better understand and predict the appropriate responses for your use case.
