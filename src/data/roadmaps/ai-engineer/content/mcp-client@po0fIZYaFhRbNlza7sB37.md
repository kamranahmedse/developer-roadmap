# MCP Client

The MCP Client is a software component that allows AI agents to interact with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It handles the communication, serialization, and deserialization of data exchanged between the agent and the server, enabling the agent to access and manage contextual information relevant to its tasks. This client simplifies the process of integrating agents with the MCP ecosystem.
