# Chroma

In AI engineering, Chroma typically refers to an open-source vector database and AI-native embedding database designed to handle and store large-scale embeddings and semantic vectors. It is used in applications that require fast, efficient similarity searches, such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and AI systems dealing with text, images, and other high-dimensional data.
