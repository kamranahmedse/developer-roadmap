# Image Generation

Image generation is a process in artificial intelligence where models create new images based on input prompts or existing data. It involves using generative models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), or more recently, transformer-based models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion.
