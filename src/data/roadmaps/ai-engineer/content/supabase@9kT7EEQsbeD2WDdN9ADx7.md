# Supabase

Supabase Vector is an extension of the Supabase platform, specifically designed for AI and machine learning applications that require vector operations. It leverages PostgreSQL's pgvector extension to provide efficient vector storage and similarity search capabilities. This makes Supabase Vector particularly useful for applications involving embeddings, semantic search, and recommendation systems. With Supabase Vector, developers can store and query high-dimensional vector data alongside regular relational data, all within the same PostgreSQL database.
