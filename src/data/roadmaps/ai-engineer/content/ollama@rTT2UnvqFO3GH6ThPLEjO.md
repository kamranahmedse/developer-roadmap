Ollama is a platform that offers large language models (LLMs) designed to run locally on personal devices, enabling AI functionality without relying on cloud services. It focuses on privacy, performance, and ease of use by allowing users to deploy models directly on laptops, desktops, or edge devices, providing fast, offline AI capabilities. With tools like the Ollama SDK, developers can integrate these models into their applications for tasks such as text generation, summarization, and more, benefiting from reduced latency, greater data control, and seamless local processing.
