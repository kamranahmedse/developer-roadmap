# Chat Completions API

The OpenAI Chat Completions API is a powerful interface that allows developers to integrate conversational AI into applications by utilizing models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. It is designed to manage multi-turn conversations, keeping context across interactions, making it ideal for chatbots, virtual assistants, and interactive AI systems. With the API, users can structure conversations by providing messages in a specific format, where each message has a role (e.g., "system" to guide the model, "user" for input, and "assistant" for responses).
