# Weaviate

Weaviate is an open-source vector database that allows users to store, search, and manage high-dimensional vectors, often used for tasks like semantic search and recommendation systems. It enables efficient similarity searches by converting data (like text, images, or audio) into embeddings and indexing them for fast retrieval. Weaviate also supports integrating external data sources and schemas, making it easy to combine structured and unstructured data.
