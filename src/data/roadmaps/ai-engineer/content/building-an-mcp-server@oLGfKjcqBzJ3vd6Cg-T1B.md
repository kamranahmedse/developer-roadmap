# Building an MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server acts as an intermediary between AI agents and various data sources or tools. It provides a standardized way for agents to access and interact with external information, enabling them to perform tasks that require context beyond their internal knowledge. Building an MCP server involves defining the API endpoints, handling requests from agents, retrieving data from relevant sources, and formatting the responses in a way that the agents can understand.
