# Prompt Injection Attacks

Prompt injection attacks are a type of security vulnerability where malicious inputs are crafted to manipulate or exploit AI models, like language models, to produce unintended or harmful outputs. These attacks involve injecting deceptive or adversarial content into the prompt to bypass filters, extract confidential information, or make the model respond in ways it shouldn't. For instance, a prompt injection could trick a model into revealing sensitive data or generating inappropriate responses by altering its expected behavior.
