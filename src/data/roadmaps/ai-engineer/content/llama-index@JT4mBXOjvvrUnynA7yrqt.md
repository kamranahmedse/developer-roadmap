# Llama Index

LlamaIndex, formerly known as GPT Index, is a tool designed to facilitate the integration of large language models (LLMs) with structured and unstructured data sources. It acts as a data framework that helps developers build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications by indexing various types of data, such as documents, databases, and APIs, enabling LLMs to query and retrieve relevant information efficiently.
