# Purpose and Functionality

A vector database is designed to store, manage, and retrieve high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) generated by AI models. Its primary purpose is to perform fast and efficient similarity searches, enabling applications to find data points that are semantically or visually similar to a given query. Unlike traditional databases, which handle structured data, vector databases excel at managing unstructured data like text, images, and audio by converting them into dense vector representations. They use indexing techniques, such as approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms, to quickly search large datasets and return relevant results. Vector databases are essential for applications like recommendation systems, semantic search, and content discovery, where understanding and retrieving similar items is crucial.
