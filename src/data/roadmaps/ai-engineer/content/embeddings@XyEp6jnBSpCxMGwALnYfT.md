# Embeddings

Embeddings are dense, continuous vector representations of data, such as words, sentences, or images, in a lower-dimensional space. They capture the semantic relationships and patterns in the data, where similar items are placed closer together in the vector space. In machine learning, embeddings are used to convert complex data into numerical form that models can process more easily. For example, word embeddings represent words based on their meanings and contexts, allowing models to understand relationships like synonyms or analogies. Embeddings are widely used in tasks like natural language processing, recommendation systems, and image recognition to improve model performance and efficiency.
