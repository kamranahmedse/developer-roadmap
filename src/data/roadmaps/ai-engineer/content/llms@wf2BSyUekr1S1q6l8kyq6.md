# LLMs

LLMs, or Large Language Models, are advanced AI models trained on vast datasets to understand and generate human-like text. They can perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, and question answering. Examples include GPT-4, BERT, and T5. LLMs are capable of understanding context, handling complex queries, and generating coherent responses, making them useful for applications like chatbots, content creation, and automated support. However, they require significant computational resources and may carry biases from their training data.
