# Security and Privacy Concerns

Security and privacy concerns in AI revolve around the protection of data and the responsible use of models. Key issues include ensuring that sensitive data, such as personal information, is handled securely during collection, processing, and storage, to prevent unauthorized access and breaches. AI models can also inadvertently expose sensitive data if not properly designed, leading to privacy risks through data leakage or misuse. Additionally, there are concerns about model bias, data misuse, and ensuring transparency in how AI decisions are made.
