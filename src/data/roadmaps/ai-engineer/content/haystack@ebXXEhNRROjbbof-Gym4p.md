# Haystack

Haystack is an open-source Python framework that helps you build search and question-answering agents fast. You connect your data sources, pick a language model, and set up pipelines that find the best answer to a userâ€™s query. Haystack handles tasks such as indexing documents, retrieving passages, running the model, and ranking results. It works with many back-ends like Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, FAISS, and Pinecone, so you can scale from a laptop to a cluster. You can add features like summarization, translation, and document chat by dropping extra nodes into the pipeline. The framework also offers REST APIs, a web UI, and clear tutorials, making it easy to test and deploy your agent in production.
