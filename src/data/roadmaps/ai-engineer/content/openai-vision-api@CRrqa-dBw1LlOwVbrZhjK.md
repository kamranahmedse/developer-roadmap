# OpenAI Vision API

The OpenAI Vision API enables models to analyze and understand images, allowing them to identify objects, recognize text, and interpret visual content. It integrates image processing with natural language capabilities, enabling tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, and extracting information from photos. This API can be used for applications in accessibility, content moderation, and automation, providing a seamless way to combine visual understanding with text-based interactions.
