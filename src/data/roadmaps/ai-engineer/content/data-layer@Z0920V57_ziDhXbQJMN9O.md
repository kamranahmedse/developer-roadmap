# Data Layer in Model Context Protocol

The Data Layer within the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is responsible for managing and providing access to the data that AI agents use to reason, learn, and make decisions. It acts as an intermediary between the agent and various data sources, ensuring data is readily available, properly formatted, and securely accessed. This layer handles data storage, retrieval, caching, and transformation, enabling agents to efficiently utilize relevant information from diverse sources.
