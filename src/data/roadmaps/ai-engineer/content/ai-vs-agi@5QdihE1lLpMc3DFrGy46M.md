# AI vs AGI

AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to systems designed to perform specific tasks by mimicking aspects of human intelligence, such as pattern recognition, decision-making, and language processing. These systems, known as "narrow AI," are highly specialized, excelling in defined areas like image classification or recommendation algorithms but lacking broader cognitive abilities. In contrast, AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) represents a theoretical form of intelligence that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a human-like level. AGI would have the capacity for abstract thinking, reasoning, and adaptability similar to human cognitive abilities, making it far more versatile than today’s AI systems. While current AI technology is powerful, AGI remains a distant goal and presents complex challenges in safety, ethics, and technical feasibility.
