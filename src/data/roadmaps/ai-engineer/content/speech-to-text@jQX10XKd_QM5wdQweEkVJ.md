# Speech-to-Text

In the context of multimodal AI, speech-to-text technology converts spoken language into written text, enabling seamless integration with other data types like images and text. This allows AI systems to process audio input and combine it with visual or textual information, enhancing applications such as virtual assistants, interactive chatbots, and multimedia content analysis. For example, a multimodal AI can transcribe a video’s audio while simultaneously analyzing on-screen visuals and text, providing richer and more context-aware insights.
