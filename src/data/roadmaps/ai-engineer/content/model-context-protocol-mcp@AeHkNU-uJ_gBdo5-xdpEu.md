# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for AI agents to manage and share contextual information. It defines a structure for representing the agent's current understanding of the environment, user, and goals, enabling more effective communication and collaboration between different components of an AI system or across multiple agents. This protocol facilitates the seamless transfer of relevant data, ensuring that each agent has the necessary information to make informed decisions and perform its tasks efficiently.
