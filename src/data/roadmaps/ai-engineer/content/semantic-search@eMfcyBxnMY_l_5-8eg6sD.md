# Semantic Search

Semantic search is an AI-driven approach that focuses on understanding the meaning and context behind search queries to deliver more accurate and relevant results. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, which matches exact words, semantic search uses techniques like embeddings to capture the relationships between words and concepts. This allows it to find results that are contextually similar, even if they don't contain the exact query terms. By analyzing the intent and context behind a user's input, semantic search improves the quality of information retrieval, making it especially useful for applications like knowledge bases, recommendation systems, and content discovery platforms.
