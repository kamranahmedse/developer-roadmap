# Semantic Search

Embeddings are used for semantic search by converting text, such as queries and documents, into high-dimensional vectors that capture the underlying meaning and context, rather than just exact words. These embeddings represent the semantic relationships between words or phrases, allowing the system to understand the query’s intent and retrieve relevant information, even if the exact terms don’t match.
