# RAG Usecases

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances applications like chatbots, customer support, and content summarization by combining information retrieval with language generation. It retrieves relevant data from a knowledge base and uses it to generate accurate, context-aware responses, making it ideal for tasks such as question answering, document generation, and semantic search. RAG’s ability to ground outputs in real-world information leads to more reliable and informative results, improving user experience across various domains.
