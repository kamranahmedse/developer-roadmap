# Text-to-Speech

In the context of multimodal AI, text-to-speech (TTS) technology converts written text into natural-sounding spoken language, allowing AI systems to communicate verbally. When integrated with other modalities, such as visual or interactive elements, TTS can enhance user experiences in applications like virtual assistants, educational tools, and accessibility features. For example, a multimodal AI could read aloud text from an on-screen document while highlighting relevant sections, or narrate information about objects recognized in an image. By combining TTS with other forms of data processing, multimodal AI creates more engaging, accessible, and interactive systems for users.
