# Building an MCP Client

Building an MCP (Model Context Protocol) client involves creating software that can interact with AI models using a standardized protocol. This client acts as an intermediary, formatting requests for the model, sending them, and then processing the model's responses into a usable format for other applications or systems. Essentially, it's the piece of software that allows you to communicate with and leverage the capabilities of an AI model in a structured and consistent way.
