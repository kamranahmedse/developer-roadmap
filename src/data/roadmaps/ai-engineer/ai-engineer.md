  title: 'What is an AI Engineer?'
  description: |
    An AI Engineer uses pre-trained models and existing AI tools to improve user experiences. They focus on applying AI in practical ways, without building models from scratch. This is different from AI Researchers and ML Engineers, who focus more on creating new models or developing AI theory. The [advantages and disadvantages of AI](https://towardsdatascience.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-artificial-intelligence-182a5ef6588c) are key considerations that AI Engineers must understand to effectively implement solutions.
