# Load Balancing in API Design

Load Balancing plays a crucial role in the domain of API Design. It primarily revolves around evenly and efficiently distributing network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool. When it comes to API design, implementing load balancing algorithms is of immense importance to ensure that no single server bears too much demand. This allows for high availability and reliability by rerouting the traffic in case of server failure, effectively enhancing application performance and contributing to a positive user experience. Therefore, it's a vital tactic in ensuring the scalability and robustness of system architectures which heavily rely on API interactions.
