# HIPAA in API Design

HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a critical standard when it comes to API design in the healthcare industry. In essence, it provides the mandate for protecting sensitive patient data. Any organization dealing with protected health information (PHI) must ensure all required physical, network, and process security measures are in place. In the context of API design, HIPAA compliance means structuring endpoints, data transmission, and storage methods that align with these crucial safeguards. This encompasses encryption, access controls, audit controls, and integrity controls. Hence, understanding HIPAA is fundamental for API designers working in the healthcare domain.
