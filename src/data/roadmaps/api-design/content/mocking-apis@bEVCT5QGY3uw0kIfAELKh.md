# Mocking APIs under API Testing

API mocking is a crucial aspect of API design and testing. It involves simulating the behaviors of real APIs to test various aspects of the system without the need of the real API being readily available. During the stages of development and testing, the API might be undefined or changes in the API can be expected, hence mocking comes into the picture. In such cases, it helps software developers and testers to isolate the system and work independently, enhancing the control over the input and output of the test. The focus here ranges from testing the API for functionality, reliability, performance, to security. Therefore, understanding and implementing effective API mocking strategies can significantly streamline the API design and development process.
