# Building JSON / RESTful APIs

Building JSON/RESTful APIs involves designing and implementing APIs that adhere to the architectural constraints of Representational State Transfer (REST). These APIs use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as a format for information interchange, due to its lightweight, easy-to-understand, and universally accepted nature. A well-designed RESTful API, utilizing JSON, is key in developing applications that are scalable, maintainable, and easily integrated with other systems. This design approach enables the resources on a server to be accessed and manipulated using standard HTTP protocols, facilitating communication between different services and systems. Furthermore, it enables client-server interactions to be stateless, meaning each request from a client must contain all the information needed by the server to understand and process the request.
