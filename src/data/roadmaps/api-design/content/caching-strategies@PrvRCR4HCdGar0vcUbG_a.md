# Caching Strategies in API Design

Caching in API design serves as a technique that allows you to store copies of data temporarily in places where you can access it more readily. By obtaining this data from high-speed storage rather than slower storage sources, you can help improve the overall speed and performance of the API. Multiple strategies such as HTTP caching, database caching, application caching, and CDN caching can be implemented, each with its own sets of advantages and considerations. Understanding different caching strategies in the context of API design is crucial for designing efficient, high-performing APIs.
