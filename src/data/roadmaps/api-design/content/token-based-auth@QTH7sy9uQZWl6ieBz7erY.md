# Token Based Auth in API Design

Token-based authentication is a crucial aspect of API design. It involves providing the user with a token that validates their identity after they have successfully logged in. Once the token is obtained, users can use it to access resources and services provided by the API. This token is usually passed in the headers of subsequent HTTP requests done by the client. One key advantage of token-based auth is that tokens can be created and checked by the server without storing them persistently, which can help to scale applications more easily. This authentication method enhances the security and scalability of web applications and it is mainly used in modern API strategies, including RESTful APIs.
