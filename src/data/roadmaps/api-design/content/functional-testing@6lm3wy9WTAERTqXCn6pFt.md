# Functional Testing in API Design

Functional testing in the context of API design involves validating the endpoints and key-value pairs of an API. It ensures the server response works as expected and assesses the functionality of the API whether it is performing all the intended functions correctly. Various approaches like testing request-response pairs, error codes, and data accuracy are used. Functional testing can provide invaluable insights into how well an API meets the specified requirements and whether it is ready for integration into applications.
