# JSON Web Token (JWT) in API Design 

JSON Web Tokens, or JWT, are a popular and secure method of transferring information between two parties in the domain of API design. As a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties, they play a vital role in security and authorization in modern APIs. By encoding these claims, the information can be verified and trusted with a digital signature - ensuring that the API end-points can handle requests in a secure and reliable way. JWT is a relatively lightweight and scalable method that brings improved authentication and information exchange processes in API design.
