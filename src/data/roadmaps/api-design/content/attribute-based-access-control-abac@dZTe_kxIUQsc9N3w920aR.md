# Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) - An Authorization Method in API Design

Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) is a flexible and powerful authorization method in the realm of API Design. Distinct from Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), which relies on predefined roles and permissions, ABAC uses attributes to build policies and make decisions. These attributes can be associated with the user, the action they want to perform, targeted resources, or the environment. With ABAC, finer-grained access control can be achieved, thereby improving the security and efficiency of APIs. This approach is widely used in complex and dynamic environments where access control requirements can be multifaceted and deeply context-dependent.
