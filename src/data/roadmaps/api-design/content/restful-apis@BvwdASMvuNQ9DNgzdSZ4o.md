# RESTful APIs

RESTful APIs, or Representational State Transfer APIs, are a set of conventions for designing networked applications. They utilize HTTP methods to read, update and delete data. They offer a simple and standardized way to build web services that can be easily consumed by different clients. The key principles of a RESTful API include stateless client-server communication, cacheable data, and a uniform interface, making the API easy to understand, flexible, and scalable. Moreover, it relies heavily on the use of resources and their representations, making it a popular choice in API design due to its performance, scalability, simplicity, and reliability.
