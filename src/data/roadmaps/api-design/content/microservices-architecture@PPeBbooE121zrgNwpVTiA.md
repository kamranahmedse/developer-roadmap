# Microservices Architecture

When it comes to API Design, Microservices Architecture plays a crucial role. It represents a unique method of developing software systems that focuses on building single-function modules with well-defined interfaces. Each microservice runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism (often HTTP resources API) to serve a specific business goal. This architecture allows rapid, reliable, and scalable deployment of large, complex applications. It facilitates the organization of the development team around independently deployable units, thereby enhancing productivity and speed. When designing an API, it's essential to adapt this model to get a flexible and scalable construction.
