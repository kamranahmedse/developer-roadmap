# Real-time APIs

In the realm of API Design, Real-time APIs hold significant value as they provide immediate access to the latest data as soon as they become available. Rather than relying on periodic polling for updates, Real-time APIs maintain an open connection between the client and the server which allows immediate, bi-directional data flow. These APIs are commonly used in applications which require real-time information such as live chat programs, financial trading platforms or online multiplayer games. Designing such APIs requires careful consideration of factors such as connection management, data consistency, and efficient handling of high volume data streams.
