# URI Design in API

URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string of characters used to identify a name or a resource on the Internet. Designing URIs carefully is a crucial part of creating a smooth API interface that is easy to understand, remember and use. Good URI design ensures that related resources are grouped together in a logical manner and can greatly impact the usability and maintainability of an API. It involves crafting standardised, intuitive HTTP paths that take advantage of the hierarchical nature of URLs to provide a better structure to the API. This hierarchy can then be used to expand the API over time without breaking existing clients' functionality.
