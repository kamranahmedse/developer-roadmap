# Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is an access control model where access to resources is determined by the owner of the resource. The owner has the discretion to grant or deny access to other users or groups. This means that users can control who has access to the resources they own, allowing for flexible and personalized access management.
