# Performance Metrics in API Design

API Design performance metrics play a critical role in ensuring APIs are efficient, effective, and absolutely fit for their intended purpose. The performance of an API can profoundly impact the user experience and overall system performance. Therefore, it is crucial to define and monitor a set of performance metrics. These may include response times, throughput, error rates, and others that measure system health and resource utilization. By prioritizing these metrics in the context of API Design, developers can create APIs that not only meet functional requirements but also deliver desired performance levels.
