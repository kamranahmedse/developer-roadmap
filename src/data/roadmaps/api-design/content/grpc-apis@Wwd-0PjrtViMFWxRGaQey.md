# gRPC

gRPC is a platform agnostic serialization protocol that is used to communicate between services. Designed by Google in 2015, it is a modern alternative to REST APIs. It is a binary protocol that uses HTTP/2 as a transport layer. It is a high performance, open source, general-purpose RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. It's main use case is for communication between two different languages within the same application. You can use Python to communicate with Go, or Java to communicate with C#.
