# Standards and Compliance in API Design

When designing APIs, it's crucial to consider the concept of standards and compliance. Standards represent the set of rules and best practices that guide developers to create well-structured and easily maintainable APIs. They can range from the proper structure of the endpoints, the standardization of error responses, to naming conventions, and the usage of HTTP verbs. Compliance on the other hand, emphasizes on meeting protocol requirements or standards such as REST or SOAP. Furthermore, operating within regulated industries can also necessitate certain compliance measures like GDPR, HIPAA and others. Compliance in API Design ensures interoperability and safety of data transmission between systems.
