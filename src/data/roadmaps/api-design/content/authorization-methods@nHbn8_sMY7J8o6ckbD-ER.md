# Authorization Methods in API Design

In API design, authorization methods play a crucial role in ensuring the security and integrity of data transactions. They are the mechanisms through which an API identifies and validates a user, system, or application before granting them access to specific resources. These methods include Basic Authentication, OAuth, Token-based authentication, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and API Key based, among others. So, understanding these methods enhances the ability to design APIs that effectively protect resources while allowing necessary access. Each method has its own pros and cons, usage scenarios and security features that make them more suitable for certain situations rather than others.
