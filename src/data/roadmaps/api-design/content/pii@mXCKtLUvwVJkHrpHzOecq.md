# PII under Standards and Compliance

Personal Identifiable Information (PII) under Standards and Compliance is a crucial aspect of API Design. It refers to the secure handling and transmission of personal data such as names, addresses, and credit card numbers, which APIs often deal with. In this context, APIs must be built under strict compliance with standards such as GDPR, HIPAA or PCI DSS, which regulate the protection of personal data. These standards ensure that personal data is not misused and that user privacy is respected. Any violations can lead to hefty fines and damage to the company's reputation. Understanding PII and designing APIs in accordance with applicable regulations is vital for a robust, secure, and compliant API design.
