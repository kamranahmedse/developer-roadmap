# HTTP Caching in API Design

HTTP caching is a key aspect of API design which involves storing copies of responses to HTTP requests to speed up future requests. When an API receives the same request multiple times, instead of processing each request separately, it can use a previously stored response, thereby improving performance and efficiency. The cache is governed by headers on the HTTP requests and responses. Understanding and implementing HTTP caching in API design can drastically reduce latency, network traffic and improve the speed of an API.
