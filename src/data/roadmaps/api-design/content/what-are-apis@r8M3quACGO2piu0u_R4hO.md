# What are APIs

APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, provide a manner in which software applications communicate with each other. They abstract the complexity of applications to allow developers to use only the essentials of the software they are working with. They define the methods and data formats an application should use in order to perform tasks, like sending, retrieving, or modifying data. Understanding APIs is integral to mastering modern software development, primarily because they allow applications to exchange data and functionality with ease, thus enabling integration and convergence of technological services. Therefore, a solid understanding of what APIs are forms the basic cornerstone of API design.
