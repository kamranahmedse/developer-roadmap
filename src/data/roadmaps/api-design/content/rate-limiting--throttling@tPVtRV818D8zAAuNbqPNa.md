# Rate Limiting / Throttling in API Design

Rate Limiting, often referred to as Throttling, is a fundamental aspect of API Design aimed at controlling the number of requests a client can make to an API within a specified timeframe. This technique ensures fair usage, enhances security, prevents server overload, and allows an even distribution of resources. It also minimizes the risks associated with abusive behaviors or DDoS attacks. Effective rate limiting strategy involves defining the limits based on the API's capacity and clients' reasonable needs, with flexibility to tweak these limits when necessary. Understanding rate limiting and its significance is crucial for building resilient, secure, and scalable API platforms.
