# RFC 7807 - Problem Details for HTTP APIs in Error Handling

The practice of API Design includes a significant focus on handling errors effectively and transparently. Among the widespread standards being adopted, the RFC 7807 or Problem Details for HTTP APIs plays a crucial role. This specification provides a standardized format for sending problem or error details from an HTTP API so developers engaging with the API do not need to parse non-standard error messages and can anticipate the structure of potential errors. In essence, RFC 7807 improves the usability and comprehension of your API, providing a better developer experience and encouraging the efficient use of your API. Implementing it paves the way to robust and accountable systems, where issues can be traced, identified, and solved more conveniently.
