# HTTP Status Codes

HTTP Status Codes are an essential part of API Design, providing important information about the result of a request made to a server. They are 3-digit numbers where the first digit defines the class of response, while the last two digits do not have any categorization value. For instance, '200' stands for a successful HTTP request, while '404' signifies that a requested resource could not be found on the server. Efficient use of these codes can enhance API's robustness, making it more understandable and easier to debug.
