# Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is a security model where the operating system or security kernel controls access to resources based on a fixed set of rules and security clearances. Unlike discretionary access control (DAC) where users can grant access to resources they own, in MAC, access is determined by a central authority. Each resource and user is assigned a security label, and access is granted only if the user's label dominates the resource's label, ensuring a strict and centrally managed security policy.
