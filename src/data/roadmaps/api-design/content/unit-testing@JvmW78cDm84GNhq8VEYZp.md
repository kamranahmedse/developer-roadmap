# Unit Testing in API Design

Unit Testing, in the context of API design, refers to the process of testing the individual components or functions of an API independently to ensure that each part is working correctly. It is typically performed at the development stage. The chief goal of Unit Testing is to isolate each component and validate its correct operation, thereby increasing confidence in the stability of the API as a whole. It lays a solid foundation for integration testing and ultimately leads to reliable, bug-free APIs. Whether your API is RESTful, SOAP, or GraphQL, unit testing is a critical step in API design and development.
