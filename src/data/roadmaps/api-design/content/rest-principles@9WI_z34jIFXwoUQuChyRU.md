# REST Principles in API Design 

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an important architectural style used in API design. It defines a set of rules and conventions through which systems communicate over a network. Key characteristics of REST include statelessness, client-server communication, cacheability, and a uniform interface. Understanding and applying these principles properly can help in designing robust, scalable, and high-performance APIs. REST principles revolve around resources and their manipulation to achieve desired outcomes. By following these principles, developers can ensure that their API design is in line with web standards, thus improving interoperability across different systems.
