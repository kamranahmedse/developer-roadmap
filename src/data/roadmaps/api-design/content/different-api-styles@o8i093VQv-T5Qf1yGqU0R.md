# Different API Styles 

Application Programming Interface (API) design isn't a one-size-fits-all endeavor. APIs can be structured in various styles, each with its own unique characteristics, advantages, and use cases. Early identification of the appropriate API style is crucial in ensuring a functional, efficient and seamless end-user experience. Commonly used API styles include REST, SOAP, GraphQL, and gRPC. Understanding these diverse API styles would help in making better design choices, fostering 
efficient overall system architecture, and promoting an intuitive and easy-to-use application.
