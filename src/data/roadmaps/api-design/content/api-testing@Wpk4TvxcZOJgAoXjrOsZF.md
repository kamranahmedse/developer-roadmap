# API Testing

API Testing refers to the process of checking the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). It plays a crucial role in API design as it ensures that the APIs work correctly and as expected. This kind of testing does not require a user interface and mainly focuses on the business logic layer of the software architecture. API Testing is integral to guarantee that the data communication and responses between different software systems are error-free and streamlined.
