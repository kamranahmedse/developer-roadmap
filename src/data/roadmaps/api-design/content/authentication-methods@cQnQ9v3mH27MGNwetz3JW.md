# Authentication Methods in API Design

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are critical components in software development that allow different software systems to communicate and share functionality. To ensure secure communication, it's essential to authenticate the parties involved in the API transactions. The authentication process confirms the identity of the API user. There are numerous authentication methods available when designing an API, each with its own pros and cons. This includes Basic Authentication, API Key Authentication, OAuth, and JWT among others. Understanding these different methods and their best use cases is fundamental to designing secure and effective APIs.
