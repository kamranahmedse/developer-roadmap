# ReBAC

Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC) is an authorization model that determines access rights based on the relationships between users and resources. Instead of relying solely on roles or attributes, ReBAC considers the connections and associations between entities within a system. This allows for fine-grained control over who can access what, based on their relationship to the data or resources in question.
