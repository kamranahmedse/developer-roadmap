# HTTP Versions in API Design

HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol is pivotal in the world of API design. HTTP versions specify how data should be packaged and transported, as well as how web servers and browsers should respond to commands. Understanding different HTTP versions and their features is essential for API designers as it directly impacts how well an API can communicate with other software and systems. From HTTP/1.0, the initial version of HTTP to HTTP/2 and the latest version HTTP/3, each version brings in improvements in speed, data transmission capabilities, and security. Selecting an appropriate HTTP version is crucial for API efficiency and performance.
