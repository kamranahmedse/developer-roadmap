# HATEOAS in API Design

Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS) is a key concept in the design of RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It implies that the API delivers data as well as information about available interactions. By utilizing hypermedia, it contributes to the self-descriptiveness and discoverability of the API. When correctly implemented, clients only need generic knowledge about hypermedia, not specific API semantics, which can significantly simplify client implementations and make APIs more flexible to changes. The principle of HATEOAS can enforce a more structured, standardized approach to API design and development.
