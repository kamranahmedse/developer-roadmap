# Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)

Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC) is an authorization method that determines access rights based on a set of policies. Instead of directly assigning permissions to users or roles, PBAC evaluates requests against these policies, which define the conditions under which access is granted or denied. These policies can consider various attributes of the user, the resource being accessed, and the environment to make fine-grained authorization decisions.
