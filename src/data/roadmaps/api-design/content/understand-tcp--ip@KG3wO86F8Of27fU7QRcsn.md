# Understand TCP / IP

When designing APIs, an essential building block is the understanding of TCP/IP. TCP/IP, standing for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is the suite of communications protocols used to connect hosts on the Internet. It provides ordered, error-checked delivery of streams of bytes from a program on one computer to another program on another computer. If you want to understand how APIs communicate over networks, knowing the fundamental working of TCP/IP is indispensable. Fully appreciating this topic will strengthen your grasp on API design and help you make more informed decisions when creating APIs.
