# Handling CRUD Operations in API Design

When designing APIs, one needs to account for various types of interactions with data - these typically revolve around the CRUD operations; Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Whether the API is designed for a banking app or a social media platform, the need to create new data, read or retrieve existing data, update or modify that data, and delete unnecessary data is universal.

Therefore, mastering CRUD operations in API design is a fundamental skill. Effective handling of CRUD operations facilitates seamless interaction between the front-end and back-end systems, and ensures proper data management, thereby improving user experience.
