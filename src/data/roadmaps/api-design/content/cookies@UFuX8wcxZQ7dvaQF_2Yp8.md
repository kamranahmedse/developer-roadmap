# Cookies in API Design

Cookies play an instrumental role in the field of API (Application Programming Interface) design. Essentially, cookies are small bits of data stored on a user's browser that enables stateful HTTP sessions, by storing pertinent information between server communications. In API design, cookies are especially useful when authentication is required. Cookies can store session tokens, thereby allowing users to stay logged in across multiple sessions or different web pages. Understanding cookies and how they function is vital in API design for sustaining user sessions, providing enhanced user experience, and securing user information.
