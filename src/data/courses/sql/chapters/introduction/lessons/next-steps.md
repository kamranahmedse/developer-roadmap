Now that we have got the theoretical part out of the way, let's dive into the practical part of SQL. In our next chapter, we will learn about the basics of SQL; we will cover the basics of selecting data from a database. This will give you a taste of what SQL is and how it works preparing you for the next chapters covering more complex topics.

## Coding Environment

We don't expect you to have a database setup on your local machine. All our lessons will have the coding environment setup with the database ready for you to use and practice. We will be using a hypothetical pre-populated databases throughout this course to help you learn SQL. Additional things to note about the coding environment:

- Our database environment is not persistent. This means that if you close the browser or refresh the page, the database will be reset to its original state.
- We are using SQLite for our coding environment. You don't need to know anything about SQLite to follow this course as the concepts we will be covering are the same for any other database.

See you in the next chapter!
