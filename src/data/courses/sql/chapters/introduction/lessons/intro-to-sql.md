The SQL language is widely used today across web frameworks and database applications. Knowing SQL gives you the freedom to explore your data, and the power to make better decisions. By learning SQL, you will also learn concepts that apply to nearly every data storage system.

The statements covered in this course use SQLite Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). You can also access a glossary of all the SQL commands taught in this course.

We have some code sample here for users to test. For example this is an example of `inline-code` entry and below is an example of a code block:


```javascript
const someVariable = 'xyz';

console.log(someVariable);
```
