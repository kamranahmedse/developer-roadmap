In this short series of lessons, we are going to create a react app from scratch. We are mainly going to use React and Chakra UI and see how we can build an application that fetches the trending projects from GitHub's API and shows you in the form of listing.

If you want to get an idea of what we are going to be building have a look at [GitHunt](https://kamranahmed.info/githunt). Also the complete source code can be found at [@kamranahmedse/githunt](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/githunt)

## Intro and Basic Setup

The video below gives you the basic introduction about the project and explains what we are going to build.

In this lesson we start adding interactivity to the interface. We will be building the view switcher where you can switch between the "Grid View" and the "List View" and in the next and last lesson of the series, we are going to integrate GitHub API and show the repositories.
