![Reverse Procy Explained](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/reverse-proxy-explained-t12iw.png)

A reverse proxy is a piece of software that sits between clients and backend servers, forwarding client requests to the appropriate server and returning the server's response to the client. It helps with load balancing, security, caching, and handling SSL termination.

An example of a reverse proxy is **Nginx**. For example, if you have a web application running on several backend servers, Nginx can distribute incoming HTTP requests evenly among these servers. This setup improves performance, enhances fault tolerance, and ensures that no single server is overwhelmed by traffic.
