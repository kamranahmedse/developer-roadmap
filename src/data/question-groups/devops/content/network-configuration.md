Managing the network configuration is not a trivial task, especially when the architecture is big and complex.

- Specifically in a cloud environment, managing network configurations involves several steps:
Creating and isolating resources within Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), organizing them into subnets, and controlling traffic using security groups and network ACLs. 
- Set up load balancers to distribute traffic for better performance, while setting up DNS services at the same time to manage domain routing. 
- Have VPNs and VPC peering connect cloud resources securely with other networks. 
- Finally, automation tools like Terraform handle network setups consistently, and monitoring tools ensure everything runs smoothly.
