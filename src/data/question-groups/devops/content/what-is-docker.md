Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to create, deploy, and run applications within lightweight, portable containers. These containers package an application along with all of its dependencies, libraries, and configuration files.

That, in turn, ensures that the application can run consistently across various computing environments.

Docker has become one of the most popular DevOps tools because it provides a consistent and isolated environment for development, continuous testing, and deployment. This consistency helps to eliminate the common "it works on my machine" problem by ensuring that the application behaves the same way, regardless of where it is run—whether on a developer's local machine, a testing server, or in production.

Additionally, Docker simplifies the management of complex applications by allowing developers to break them down into smaller, manageable microservices, each running in its own container.

This approach not only supports but also enhances scalability, and flexibility and it makes it easier to manage dependencies, version control, and updates.
