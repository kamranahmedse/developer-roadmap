# Beware AWS Limits

> Be aware of AWS service limits before you deploy.

Various service limits are enforced which aren't highlighted until you're actually trying to deploy your application and get the error notification. These limits can easily be increased by making a request to AWS support, however that can involve a significant turn around time (as low as a few minutes, up to a few days, based on past experience), during which you won't be able to finish deploying. A few days before deploying, you should consult the service limits page to see if you think you're going to exceed any of them, and make your support request ahead of time. You will need to make a separate request to each department where you need a limit increased. It's also worth pointing out that some limits are global, while others are per-region.
