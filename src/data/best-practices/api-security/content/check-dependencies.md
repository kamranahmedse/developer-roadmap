# Dependencies

> Check your dependencies for known vulnerabilities and keep them up to date.

Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and components can be exploited by attackers to gain access to your system or data. These vulnerabilities can be introduced through outdated or insecure dependencies that have not been updated with the latest security patches.

By regularly checking for vulnerabilities and keeping your dependencies up to date, you can ensure that your API is not susceptible to known security risks. This can be done by using automated tools or services that scan your codebase and provide reports on any vulnerabilities found in your dependencies. By addressing these vulnerabilities promptly, you can reduce the risk of your API being compromised by attackers.
