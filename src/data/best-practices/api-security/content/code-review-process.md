# Code Review Process

> Use a code review process and disregard self-approval.

Having a good code review process allows for additional sets of eyes to review the code and identify potential security issues or vulnerabilities. A code review process involves other team members reviewing the code to ensure it follows best practices and is secure. Disregarding self-approval means that the developer who wrote the code should not be the only one responsible for approving it for release. This helps to catch potential mistakes or oversights before the code is deployed, reducing the risk of security breaches or other issues.
