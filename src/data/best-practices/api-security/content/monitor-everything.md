# Monitor Everything

> Use agents to monitor all requests, responses and errors.

Using agents to monitor all requests, responses, and errors allows for real-time monitoring and detection of any abnormal activity or potential attacks. These agents can be configured to track metrics such as response times, error rates, and usage patterns, which can help identify any anomalies that could be indicative of an attack. By monitoring all requests and responses, the agents can provide visibility into the behavior of the API, which can help identify any potential security vulnerabilities or weaknesses. Additionally, agents can be used to log and analyze all data flowing through the API, which can be useful for debugging and auditing purposes.

To use agents for monitoring, a dedicated monitoring solution can be deployed alongside the API. This solution can be configured to capture data from all requests and responses, and analyze the data for any anomalies or issues. Agents can be implemented using various monitoring tools and technologies such as agents for application performance monitoring (APM), log monitoring, and network monitoring. The agents should be configured to provide real-time alerts to security teams if any suspicious activity is detected, allowing for immediate action to be taken.
