# Efficient Database Indexing

In web application development, efficient database indexing is instrumental in boosting backend performance. Indexes significantly cut short the time it takes for databases to retrieve and write data by providing swift navigational access to the rows in a table. For instance, a database without indexes may need to scan every row in a table to retrieve the required data, resulting in slow query response time. However, if the table is indexed, the same database can locate the data quickly and efficiently. It's akin to finding a book in a library - without a cataloguing system (index), you'd have to go through each book manually. With a cataloguing system (index), you can swiftly locate the exact book you need. Therefore, proper indexing strategy is key for high backend performance.
