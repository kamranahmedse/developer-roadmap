# Fine-Tuning ORM Queries

For backend performance in web applications, one must diligently monitor and fine-tune Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) queries. Why? ORMs help to convert data between incompatible types, enabling database manipulations using an object-oriented paradigm. However, they can also generate heavy, inefficient SQL queries without proper management, creating lag in web performance. By keenly watching and fine-tuning these queries, you can ensure a smoother and faster data retrieval process, resulting in an overall boost to backend performance. For instance, ORM functions like eager loading and batch loading can be used to fetch related data in fewer queries, reducing load times and enhancing performance.
