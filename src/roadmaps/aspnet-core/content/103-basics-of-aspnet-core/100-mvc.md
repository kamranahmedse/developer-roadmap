# MVC

MVC is an architectural design pattern used for developing applications, specifically web applications. This pattern separates an application into three main logical components **Model View Controller**. Each architectural component is built to handle specific development aspects of an application.

- **Model** - Handles all data-related logic. Interacts with Database.
- **View** - Handles UI part of the applications (data presentation).
- **Controller** - Handles request flow, and acts as an intermediary between view and model.
