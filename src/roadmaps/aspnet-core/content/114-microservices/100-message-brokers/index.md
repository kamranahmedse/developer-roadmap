# Message Brokers

Message Brokers are systems that provide a messaging infrastructure for applications and services to communicate with each other in a reliable, secure and scalable way. They act as a central hub for sending and receiving messages between different applications, services and devices.

In the context of ASP.NET, message brokers can be used to send and receive messages between different parts of an application or between different applications or services, enabling them to communicate with each other in a decoupled and asynchronous manner.
