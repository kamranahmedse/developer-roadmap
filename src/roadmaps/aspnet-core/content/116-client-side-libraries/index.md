# Client Side Libraries

Client-side libraries in ASP.NET are libraries that are used to add functionality and enhance the user experience of web applications on the client-side, or the browser. Some popular client-side libraries in ASP.NET include jQuery, Bootstrap, React.js, Angular.js, and Vue.js, which can be easily integrated with ASP.NET applications by including them as a dependency in the project, and can be used to enhance the user interface, add interactive elements, and improve the user experience of your application.
