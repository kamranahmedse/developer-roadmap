# FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

> The key features are:

- **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#performance).
- **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. 
- **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.
- **Intuitive**: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
- **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
- **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
- **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
- **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (previously known as Swagger) and [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).
