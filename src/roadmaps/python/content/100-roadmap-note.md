# Note

This roadmap specifically covers **Python and the ecosystem** around it. You will notice that it is missing things like version control, databases, software design, architecture and other things that are not directly related to Python; this is intentional. Have a look at the [Backend Roadmap](/backend/) for a more comprehensive overview of the frontend ecosystem.
