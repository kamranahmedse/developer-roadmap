# Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that creates the dependencies of a class and provides those objects to the class when required. Angular being a nice framework, provides a built-in dependency injection mechanism that creates and provides a runtime version of a dependency value using dependency injectors.
