# Ng generate

ng generate is used to create the component in angular project. These are the two main ways to generate a new component in Angular: using ng g c <component_name>, and using ng generate component <component_name>. Using either of these two commands, the new component can be generated pretty easily and followed by the suitable component name of your choice.
