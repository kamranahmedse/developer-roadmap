# Lambdas

Lambdas, also known as anonymous functions, are a fundamental concept in Dart and Flutter. They are a way to create short, inline functions that can be passed as arguments to other functions or assigned to variables.

Here are some common use cases for lambdas in Dart Flutter:

- Event Handlers: You can use lambdas as event handlers for widgets, such as buttons.
- Callbacks: You can use lambdas as callbacks to pass into functions that execute later.
- Streams: You can use lambdas to handle events in a Stream.
- Filtering: You can use lambdas to filter data in a collection using functions like where and `firstWhere`.

Lambdas are defined using the `=>` operator and can take zero or more arguments. They can also contain expressions, statements, and return values.
