# Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a free web analytics service provided by Google that helps to understand user behavior and measure app performance for mobile apps, including those built with Flutter.

With Google Analytics, Flutter developers can track user interactions with their app, including page views, events, and user properties, and use this data to gain insights into user behavior. Google Analytics provides a range of tools and features for analyzing this data, including real-time dashboards, user segmentation, and funnels.
