# Note

This roadmap specifically covers **React and the ecosystem** around it. You will notice that it is missing things like version control, package managers, build tools, linters, task runners and other things that are not directly related to React; this is intentional. Have a look at the [Frontend Roadmap](/frontend/) for a more comprehensive overview of the frontend ecosystem.
