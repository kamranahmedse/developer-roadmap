# Any

With `any` you can access any properties of it (which will in turn be of type any), call it like a function, assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else that’s syntactically legal:

    ```
    let obj: any = { x: 0 };
    // None of the following lines of code will throw compiler errors.
    // Using `any` disables all further type checking, and it is assumed 
    // you know the environment better than TypeScript.
    obj.foo();
    obj();
    obj.bar = 100;
    obj = "hello";
    const n: number = obj;
    ```
