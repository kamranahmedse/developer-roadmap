Jasmine is a very popular JavaScript BDD (behavior-driven development) framework for unit testing JavaScript applications. It provides utilities that can be used to run automated tests for both synchronous and asynchronous code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM.
