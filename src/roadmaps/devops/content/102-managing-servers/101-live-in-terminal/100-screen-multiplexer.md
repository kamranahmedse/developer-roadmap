# Screen

Screen  is  a  full-screen  window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes (typically interactive shells). Each virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal and, in addition, several control functions from the ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for multiple character sets). There is  a  scrollback  history buffer for each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text regions between windows.

See `man screen` or `screen -h` for further information
