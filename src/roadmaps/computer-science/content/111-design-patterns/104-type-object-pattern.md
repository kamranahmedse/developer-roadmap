# Type Object Pattern

Type object pattern is a creational design pattern that allows us to create a new object of a type without exposing the object creation logic to the client. It is used when we need to create a new object of a type, but we don't know which type we need to create until runtime. It is like a factory pattern, but instead of returning a new object of a type, it returns a new object of a type that is already created.
