# Brute Force Search

Brute force search is a simple algorithm that checks for a pattern in a string by comparing each character of the string with the first character of the pattern. If the first character matches, it then compares the next character of the string with the next character of the pattern and so on. If all the characters of the pattern match, then the pattern is found. If the first character does not match, then the algorithm compares the second character of the string with the first character of the pattern and so on.
