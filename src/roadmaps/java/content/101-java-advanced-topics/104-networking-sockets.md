# Networking sockets

- Java Networking is a concept of connecting two or more computing devices together so that we can share resources.
- Java socket programming provides facility to share data between different computing devices.
- A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.
