  <Question isActive question='What is Backend Development?'>
    <Answer>
      <p class='mb-3'>
        Backend web development is the part of web development that deals with
        the server-side of a web application. This includes creating and
        managing the server-side logic, connecting the application to a
        database, creating server-side APIs, handling user authentication and
        authorization, and processing and responding to user requests. It often
        involves the use of programming languages such as Python, Java, Ruby,
        PHP, JavaScript (Node.js), and .NET languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        A backend developer is responsible for the development of server-side
        components of a web application i.e. working with databases, handling
        requests, creating server-side APIs that can be consumed by frontend
        developers to retrieve and manipulate data, ensuring the scalability of
        the systems i.e. making sure that the backend can handle a high volume
        of traffic and is performant, integrating external services like payment
        gateways, message queues, cloud services, etc.

          >a backend programming language</span
        > such as Python, Ruby, Java, Go etc. Once you have got the basic to intermediate
        understanding of the language, learn about <span class='bg-yellow-100'
          >the package manager</span
        > for that language and learn how to install and use external packages into
        your applications. Learn the basics of some <span class='bg-yellow-100'
          >relational database</span
        > e.g. PostgreSQL and learn how to run simple CRUD operations. Optionally,
        you can pick up and learn a <span class='bg-yellow-100'
          >web framework</span
        > for the language of your choice as well. Learn how to build a <span
          class='bg-yellow-100'>simple RESTful API</span
        > and implement simple Authentication/Authorization into it. While you are
        learning all the items mentioned above, don't forget to learn about <span
          class='bg-yellow-100'>Git and GitHub</span
        > as well.
