# Running nodejs code

Step-1: Downloading the Node.js ‘.msi’ installer.

The first step to install Node.js on windows is to download the installer. Visit the official Node.js website i.e) https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download the .msi file according to your system environment (32-bit & 64-bit). An MSI installer will be downloaded on your system.



Step-2: Running the Node.js installer.

Now you need to install the node.js installer on your PC. You need to follow the following steps for the Node.js to be installed:-

Double click on the .msi installer.
The Node.js Setup wizard will open.

Welcome To Node.js Setup Wizard.
Select “Next”

After clicking “Next”, End-User License Agreement (EULA) will open.
Check “I accept the terms in the License Agreement”

Select “Next”

Destination Folder
Set the Destination Folder where you want to install Node.js & Select “Next”

Custom Setup
Select “Next”

Ready to Install Node.js.
Select “Install”

Click “Finish”



Step 3: Verify that Node.js was properly installed or not.

To check that node.js was completely installed on your system or not, you can run the following command in your command prompt or Windows Powershell and test it:-

C:\Users\Admin> node -v



If node.js was completely installed on your system, the command prompt will print the version of the node.js installed.

Step 4: Updating the Local npm version.

The final step in node.js installed is the updation of your local npm version(if required) – the package manager that comes bundled with Node.js.

You can run the following command, to quickly update the npm

npm install npm –global // Updates the ‘CLI’ client
