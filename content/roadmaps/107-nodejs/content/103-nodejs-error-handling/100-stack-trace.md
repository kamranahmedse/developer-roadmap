# Stack trace

If any error occurs during the execution of the program, Stack trace will be displayed automatically by the JVM for its indication. All the active stack frames at a particular instance during the execution of the program can be traced by the stack trace. This is very helpful for the debuggers because during the code debugging, we can easily identify at which point the error had occurred.
