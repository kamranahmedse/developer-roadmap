# Architect Responsibilities

To understand the necessary skills an architect needs, we first need to understand typical activities. The following list contains from my perspective the most important activities:

* Define and decide development technology and platform
* Define development standards, e.g., coding standards, tools, review processes, test approach, etc.
* Support identifying and understanding business requirements
* Design systems and take decisions based on requirements
* Document and communicate architectural definitions, design and decisions
* Check and review architecture and code, e.g., check if defined patterns and coding standards are implemented properly
* Collaborate with other architects and stakeholders
* Coach and consult developers
* Detail out and refine higher level design into lower level design

_Note: Architecture is a continuous activity, especially when it is applied in agile software development. Therefore, these activities are done over and over again._
