# Polynomial

Polynomial algorithms are algorithms that have a runtime that is a polynomial function of the input size. This means that the runtime is a function of the form `n^k` where `k` is a constant. For example, the runtime of the following algorithm is `n^2`:

```python
def polynomial_algorithm(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print(i, j)
```
