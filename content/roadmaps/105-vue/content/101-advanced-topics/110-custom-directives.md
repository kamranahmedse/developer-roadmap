# Custom Directives

So far you may have covered two forms of code reuse in Vue: [components](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html) and [composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables.html). Components are the main building blocks, while composables are focused on reusing stateful logic. Custom directives, on the other hand, are mainly intended for reusing logic that involves low-level DOM access on plain elements.
