# Proof of Stake

In the proof-of-stake system, validators (the proof-of-stake equivalent of miners) are chosen to find a block based on the number of tokens they hold rather than having an arbitrary competition between miners determine which node can add a block.

Most Proof-of-Stake blockchains have reward and penalty mechanisms. Good behaviors are encouraged through rewards. Validators receive rewards for both attesting and proposing blocks to the blockchain as a percentage of their stake.

On the flip side, bad behaviors, inactivity, and dishonest validations are subject to a penalty called slashing. This mechanism is designed to discourage malicious validator behavior and to incentivize network participation.
