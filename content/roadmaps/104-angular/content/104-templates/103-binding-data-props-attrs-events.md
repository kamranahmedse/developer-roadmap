# Binding data props attrs events

In an Angular template, a binding creates a live connection between view and the model and keeps them both in sync.

- **property**: helps you set values for properties of HTML elements or directives.
- **attributes**: helps you set values for attributes of HTML elements directly.
- **event**: lets you listen for and respond to user actions such as keystrokes, mouse movements, clicks, and touches.
- **data**: It's a combination of property and event binding and helps you share data between components.
