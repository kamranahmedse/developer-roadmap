# Function Borrowing

Function borrowing allows us to use the methods of one object on a different object without having to make a copy of that method and maintain it in two separate places. It is accomplished through the use of `.call()`, `.apply()`, or `.bind()`, all of which exist to explicitly set this on the method we are borrowing.
