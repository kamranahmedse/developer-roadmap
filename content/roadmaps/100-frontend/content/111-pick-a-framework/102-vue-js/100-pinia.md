# Pinia

Pinia is a store library for Vue.js, and can be used in Vue 2 and Vue 3, with the same API, except in SSR and its installation. It allows state sharing between pages and components around the application. As the documentation says, it is extensible, intuitive (by organization), has devtools support (in Vue.js devtools), inferred typed state even in javascript and more. In Pinia you can access, mutate, replace, use getters that works like computed, use actions, etc. The library is recommended by the official Vue.js documentation.
