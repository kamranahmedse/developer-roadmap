# React Testing Library

The React Testing Library is a very lightweight solution for testing React components. It provides light utility functions on top of react-dom and react-dom/test-utils, in a way that encourages better testing practices. Its primary guiding principle is: The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.
