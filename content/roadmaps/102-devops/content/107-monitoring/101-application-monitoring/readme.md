# Application Monitoring

Application monitoring refers to the practice of making the status and performance of a given *application* visible. This may include details such as stacktraces, error logs, and the line of code implicated in a given failure. When combined with Infrastructure monitoring, this can provide a complete picture of what is happening in your system, and why.
