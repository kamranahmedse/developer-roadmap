# htop

htop is a cross-platform ncurses-based process. It is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, and interact using a pointing device (mouse). You can observe all processes running on the system, along with their command line arguments, as well as view them in a tree format, select multiple processes and act on them all at once.
