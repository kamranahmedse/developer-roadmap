# Cloud providers
Cloud providers provide a layer of APIs to abstract infrastructure and provision it based along security and billing boundaries.  The cloud runs on servers in datacenters, but the abstractions cleverly give the appearance of interacting with a single "platform" or large application.  The ability to quickly provision, configure, and secure resources with cloud providers has been key to both the tremendous success, and complexity, of modern DevOps.
